This Wiki is done using [JSP|http://java.sun.com/products/jsp] technology, 
which hopefully makes it very easy to keep up to date and looking better than most of the Wikis based on the [original one|http://c2.com/cgi/wiki].  A custom bean handles the translation of text into HTML.

Most of the [editing markers|TextFormattingRules] have been styled according to the [Sensei's Library|http://senseis.xmp.net], the best Go sites in the Internet.  I find their markup very easy, yet clear.
