Upgrading JSPWiki to 2.8
------------------------

This file documents the steps necessary to upgrade JSPWiki 2.8 from 2.6. This document was written for two audiences: 

a. Deployers -- system administrators who want to upgrade JSPWiki , but who have not created custom JSPs, plugins, or developed against JSPWiki APIs

b. Developers -- persons who have integrated their code with JSPWiki public APIs.

Detailed instructions for both groups follow.

3. Backwards Incompatibilities

1. Required Steps
   --------------
   
   -> If you are using Tomcat, delete the $CATALINA_HOME/temp and
      $CATALINA_HOME/work directories before upgrading.
   
   -> If you are upgrading from 2.4, you should replace all of the top-level
      JSPs (relative to the webroot) with the new ones from 2.6. You
      should also copy the contents of the 2.8 release's /scripts,
      /templates, and /images directories.
      
   -> If you are upgrading from 2.6, you should copy the contents of
       the /scripts, /templates and /images directories. You do not need
       to copy the top-level JSPs (relative to the webroot), because these
       are identical to those in 2.6.

   -> You must upgrade jspwiki.properties. JSPWiki 2.8 adds several
      new properties to it. We recommend you use the 2.8 version of
      jspwiki.properties as a base, and copy your existing
      settings into it line-by-line. However, it you retain your existing
      jspwiki.properties file, you must add the following new properties:
          jspwiki.defaultprefs.*
        
      You should also add these properties, although they will default to
      sensible values if you do not:
          jspwiki.allowCreationOfEmptyPages
          jspwiki.userdatabase.uid
          jspwiki.userdatabase.lockExpiry
          jspwiki.userdatabase.attributes
   
   -> In jspwiki.properties, 'jspwiki.baseURL' is now a mandatory attribute,
      and you MUST set it to the URL that resolves to your JSPWiki webapp.
      Be careful if you use a localhost address (http://localhost/ or
      http://127.0.0.1/):  this will cause some unwanted side effects
      if your wiki is accessed from any other computer than where the
      wiki is running. Example:
          jspwiki.baseURL = http://www.jspwiki.org/wiki/
          
      Note that the trailing slash is REQUIRED.
      
   -> Replace the old WEB-INF/jspwiki.tld and JSPWiki.jar with the
      new versions.
   
   -> Add the following WEB-INF/ files from the new version to your existing WEB-INF:
          commons-fileupload-1.2.1.jar, commons-io-1.4.jar

   -> Remove the following files from yoru existing WEB-INF/:
          jug-asl-2.0.0.jar, multipartrequest.jar
         
   -> JSPWiki now wires up its own JAAS login process, and no longer
      interferes with existing JAAS login stacks. The JAAS configuration
      options that were previously set in WEB-INF/jwpwiki.jaas are now
      set in jspwiki.properties. You should make the following changes to
      jspwiki.properties in accordance with your preferred container
      login configuration (package names omitted for brevity):
      
      Old jspwiki.jaas values                      Equivalent jspwiki.properties values
      --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      CookieAuthenticationLoginModule SUFFICIENT   jspwiki.cookieAuthentication = true
      CookieAuthenticationLoginModule (omitted)    jspwiki.cookieAuthentication = false
      CookieAssertionLoginModule SUFFICIENT        jspwiki.cookieAssertions = true
      CookieAssertionLoginModule (omitted)         jspwiki.cookieAssertions = false
      AnonymousLoginModule (any value)             n/a (it is always turned on)
      
      For cookie authentication, you might also want to change the 
      jspwiki.cookieAuthentication.expiry value, which defaults to 14 days.
    
    -> If you specified a third-party JAAS LoginModule for custom authentication,
       (for example: com.foo.login.MyLoginModule REQUIRED), you must specify this
       in jspwiki.properties as follows:
           jspwiki.loginModule.class = com.foo.login.MyLoginModule
           
       If this property is not set, JSPWiki will default (as before) to the
       UserDatabaseLoginModule implementation.
           
       Note that parameters passed to your custom LoginModule is now expressed in
       jspwiki.properties also, as key/value pairs, rather than in the JAAS config
       file. The parameter names and values will be loaded to a Map and passed to
       the LoginModule as the 'options' parameter when its initialize() method
       is called. The default UserDatabaseLoginModule class does not need any options.
           jspwiki.loginModule.options.param1 = value1
           jspwiki.loginModule.options.param2 = value2
           
       If you have developed a custom LoginModule, you should also read the
       DEVELOPERS section of this document for additional information.
       
    -> If you use the JDBCUserDatabase for storage of user profiles, you must
       add the following columns to your users table:
       
          column name         type
          ----------------------------
          uid                 bigint (or other long integer equivalent)
          lockExpiry          timestamp
          attributes          longvarchar (or other large text/memo field)
  
       The primary key should also be changed to the 'uid' column. The column names
       can be re-mapped in jspwiki.properties similar to other JDBC columns.
       We do not yet have an upgrade DDL script for these new columns.

2. Suggested Steps
   ---------------
   
   -> If you are running JBOSS, you may safely delete the following entries in
      your login-config.xml: 
          <application-policy name="JSPWiki-container">
          <application-policy name="JSPWiki-custom">
         
   -> If you are running Tomcat and have configured JAAS, you may safely remove
      the following system property from CATALINA_OPTS:
          java.security.auth.login.config

3. Backwards Incompatibilities
   ---------------------------
   
   -> Vote.jsp and the vote plugin are removed in 2.8.

4. Notes
--------

   -> The method for storing passwords in UserDatabases has changed. We now
      use salted SHA-1 hashes. These are transparently upgraded on the fly
      as users log in.

3. Backwards Incompatibilities
   ---------------------------

   -> The following interfaces have changed slightly, and may introduce
      compatibility problems if you do not fix them in your custom classes.
      These interfaces are NOT generally implemented by third parties, so
      this probably will not affect you:
      
      -> com.ecyrd.jspwiki.auth.user.UserDatabase
           - removed boolean isSharedWithContainer()
      -> com.ecyrd.jspwiki.auth.user.UserProfile
           - implements java.io.Serializable
           - added java.util.Date getLockExpiry()
           - added long getUid()
           - added boolean isLocked()
           - added setLockExpiry(java.util.Date)
           - added void setUid(long)
           
      -> com.ecyrd.jspwiki.workflow.Step
           - extends java.io.Serializable
           - method getMessageArguments() now returns Serializable[] rather than Object[]
           
      All classes in JSPWiki that implement these interfaces changed also. In
      particular, your Task and Decision subclasses will need to be modified
      (slightly) to acommodate the changes to the Step interface.
   
   -> The UserDatabase implementations (e.g., JDBCUserDatabase and XMLUserDatabase)
      have been enhanced to persist the additional properties for the
      UserProfile interface. If you have implemented your own UserDatabase class,
      you should examine either of these to see how these new properties
      should be persisted. In addition, UserDatabase no longer supports any
      "shared with container" methods or behaviors. 
  
   -> Many of the Comparator classes now use the Java 5 idiom, rather than
      the old-style boolean.compare(Object).

   -> The following public fields were removed or made private:
      
      com.ecyrd.jspwiki.PropertyReader.PARAM_VAR_DECLARATION, PARAM_VAR_DECLARATION
      com.ecyrd.jspwiki.TranslatorReader.ATTACHMENT, EDIT, READ
      com.ecyrd.jspwiki.auth.AuthenticationManager.LOGIN_CONTAINER, LOGIN_CUSTOM

      com.ecyrd.jspwiki.forms.FormInfo.m_action, m_error, m_handler, m_hide, m_name
          m_result, m_status, m_submission
      com.ecyrd.jspwiki.modules.ModuleManager.LOAD_INCOMPATIBLE_MODULES
      com.ecyrd.jspwiki.parser.JSPWikiMarkupParser.CHARACTER, ELEMENT, IGNORE

      com.ecyrd.jspwiki.plugin.Image.PARAM_ALIGN, PARAM_ALT, PARAM_BORDER,
          PARAM_CAPTION, PARAM_CLASS, PARAM_HEIGHT, PARAM_LINK, PARAM_SRC,
          PARAM_STYLE, PARAM_TARGET, PARAM_WIDTH
      com.ecyrd.jspwiki.plugin.IndexPlugin.INITIALS_COLOR
      com.ecyrd.jspwiki.plugin.InsertPage.PARAM_CLASS, PARAM_DEFAULT, PARAM_MAXLENGTH,
          PARAM_PAGENAME, PARAM_SECTION, PARAM_STYLE
      com.ecyrd.jspwiki.plugin.PluginManager.DEFAULT_FORMS_PACKAGE
      com.ecyrd.jspwiki.plugin.WeblogArchivePlugin.PARAM_PAGE
      com.ecyrd.jspwiki.plugin.WeblogEntryPlugin.MAX_BLOG_ENTRIES, PARAM_ENTRYTEXT
      com.ecyrd.jspwiki.plugin.WeblogPlugin.DEFAULT_DAYS, DEFAULT_PAGEFORMAT,
          PARAM_ALLOWCOMMENTS, PARAM_DAYS, PARAM_ENTRYFORMAT, PARAM_MAXENTRIES,
          PARAM_PAGE, PARAM_STARTDATE
      com.ecyrd.jspwiki.search.SearchManager.PROP_USE_LUCENE
      com.ecyrd.jspwiki.tags.CheckLockTag.LOCKED, NOTLOCKED, OWNED
      com.ecyrd.jspwiki.tags.CheckVersionTag.FIRST, LATEST, NOTFIRST, NOTLATEST
      com.ecyrd.jspwiki.ui.admin.beans.SearchManagerBean.METHODS
      com.ecyrd.jspwiki.util.MailUtil.PROP_MAIL_AUTH
      
   -> The following public fields were deprecated, but not removed:
      -> com.ecyrd.jspwiki.auth.AuthenticationManager.PROP_SECURITY
      
   -> Workflow classes narrow their scope in several cases from Objects to Serializable,
      either as parameters or return types:
      -> com.ecyrd.jspwiki.workflow.AbstractStep.getMessageArguments() 
         now returns ava.io.Serializable[]
      -> com.ecyrd.jspwiki.workflow.Fact.getValue() now returns java.io.Serializable
      -> com.ecyrd.jspwiki.workflow.Workflow.getMessageArguments()
         now returns ava.io.Serializable[]
   
   -> Class com.ecyrd.jspwiki.TranslatorReader was deprecated, and its constructor was
      removed so that it can no longer be instantiated. It is retained strictly for
      reverse compatibility.
      
   -> Class PageRenamer was moved to package com.ecyrd.jspwiki.content.
   
   -> Class com.ecyrd.jspwiki.WikiSession method getLoginContext() was removed.
      
   -> Because of the changes under the covers to how JAAS works in 2.8, the following
      methods in SecurityVerifier were removed:
      -> isJaasConfigured()
      -> isJaasConfiguredAtStartup()
      -> jaasConfiguration()
      
   -> For security reasons, class com.ecyrd.jspwiki.auth.permissions.PermissionFactory
      was made final, and its contructor was made private to prevent direct instantiation.

   -> For security reasons, class com.ecyrd.jspwiki.auth.user.DefaultUserProfile
      was made final.

   -> Class com.ecyrd.jspwiki.rpc.RPCManager's constructor is now protected.
