        * fixed JSPWIKI-701 (Website must display disclaimer text)
        * no version bump

2011-08-07  Harry Metske <metskem@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-231
        
        * fixed JSPWIKI-699 (JBoss complaining about jspwiki.tld and oscache.tld).
        * a few minor Stripes bugs

        * 3.0.0-svn-230
        
        * JSPWIKI-691: Navigation to ./admin/Admin.jsp with a non-authorized user redirects to a blank ./Message.jsp. 
        
        * JSPWIKI-695: Change note gets sticked upon several revisions.

2011-05-09  Harry Metske <metskem@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-229
        
        * WikiTagBase sometimes tried to getMessage() on a null exception, added an extra check on that.
        
        * JavaDoc fixes
        
        * Error.jsp was is own error page causing endless loops, removed the errorPage tag.
        
        * Error.jsp was using  ${error.realCause.class.name} causing :
           javax.el.ELException: The identifier [class] is not a valid Java identifier as required by 
           section 1.19 of the EL specification (Identifier ::= Java language identifier). 
           This check can be disabled by setting the system property org.apache.el.parser.SKIP_IDENTIFIER_CHECK to true.
           
           An extra getter was added on the MessageActionBean to circumvent this.
           We should now at least get clearer error messages.
        
2011-05-08  Harry Metske <metskem@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-228
        
        * fixed JSPWIKI-689 (InstallActionBean does not create admin user), most code
          taken from JSPWiki 2.8.
        
        * On Install.jsp I also moved the logdir and workdir fields from Advanced to Basic,
           since they are required fields.
           
         * Removed unmappable characters from CreoleToJSPWikiTranslatorTest (causing compile warnings)
        
2011-04-27  Juan Pablo Santos (juanpablo AT apache DOT org)
        
        * 3.0.0-svn-227
        
        * JSPWIKI-636: fixed DefaultAclManagerTest.testPrintAcl(). Saving pages involves calling 
        RenderingManager.getRenderedDocument(), which can return cached or non-cached WikiDocuments. In  
        the first case, ACLs were not associated to current WikiPage, whereas in the second one yes
        (DefaultAclManager.parseAcl() is called as part of MarkupParser.parse()). 
        
        * JSPWIKI-636: 27 tests where locale-dependant (test assertions assumed english locale), so
        TestEngine and WikiContextFactory enforce it when building mock requests.

2011-04-03  Harry Metske <metskem@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-226
        
        * fixed JSPWIKI-688 (Poor performance of CreoleToJSPWikiTranslator), thanks to Jelmer Kuperus.
        
2011-03-24  Juan Pablo Santos (juanpablo AT apache DOT org)
        
        * 3.0.0-svn-225
        
        * JSPWIKI-636: fixed RPCHandlerTest.testRecentChanges(). JCR Paths are always lower-cased,
        and ContentManager.getAllPages( String space ) didn't lower-case it's parameter in order to 
        make a JCR path-based query. One test failure remaining.

2011-01-24  Harry Metske <metskem@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-224
        
        * Extended the list of lucene searchable file suffixes, we now do 
           ".txt", ".ini", ".xml", ".html", "htm", ".mm", ".htm", ".xhtml", ".java", ".c", ".cpp",
            ".php", ".asm", ".sh",  ".properties", ".kml", ".gpx", ".loc"

2010-12-12  Harry Metske <metskem@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-223
        
        * JSPWIKI-671: WikiPageRenameEvent not fired during page rename.

2010-12-05 Dirk Frederickx <brushed@apache.org>

        * v3.0.0-svn-222

        * JSPWIKI-667: Fixed Scorebar issue in Google Chrome. (workaround js error)
        
        * JSPWIKI-675: Fixed Unicode support in quickEdit (javascript regexp)

        * JSPWIKI-674: Fixed support for nested tabbed sections

2010-09-30  Harry Metske <metskem@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-221
        
        * JSPWIKI-664 SpecialPage renamed, but wikipages not changed.
        Changed all references to "FindPage" into "Search" .

2010-08-29  Harry Metske <metskem@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-220
        
        * JSPWIKI-660 Support external properties in WikiEngine (idea from John McKinney)
          You can now override individual properties in jspwiki.properties using standard
          Java System properties.

2010-05-16  Harry Metske <metskem@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-219
        
        * JSPWIKI-646 JSPWiki cannot run without unpacking the war file
        
2010-05-08  Harry Metske <metskem@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-218
        
        * JSPWIKI-392 and JSPWIKI-442 invalid asserted usernames
        
2010-03-27 Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-217

        * Renamed EventResolution to AjaxResolution (I had made changes
        similar to AJAX/JSON to his, independently).

2010-03-21 Dirk Frederickx <brushed@apache.org>

        * v3.0.0-svn-216 : AJAX/JSON fixes.

        * EventResolution now returns a static JSON object iso of 
          JavaScriptResolution.  JSON objects are more safe (no eval)
          but assume that the converted java beans are acyclical.
          (which is ok in our case)
          The overall AJAX/JSON handling is still work in progress.
        
        * The client javascript is updated accordingly,
          with a simplified Stripes.submitFormEvent()

        * The Preview functionality is now working through JSON objects.
        
        * I'm still working on the quick-navigation search functionality.
          For now, it is broken: the SearchActionBean.quickSearch() 
          needs to some update to use the new json format.
          
        * Fixed the AttachmentTab so slimbox preview of attachments is 
          working again.
          
        * Fixed the section edit links.
        
        * Fixed the section handling routines. Apparently the element with 
          ID="pagecontent" was removed.

          
2010-03-19 Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-215

        * Re-wrote ReferenceManager (again) to use JCR UUIDs internally
        to track references between pages. This change means that the
        nagging PageRenamer unit test failures are now fixed. RefManager
        is also considerably simpler for rename cases, although some of
        that is offset by slight added complexity in ContentManager for
        add and delete cases.

        * New singleton-per-wiki class WikiPathResolver, part of the
        org.apache.content package, caches UUIDs and WikiPaths. It also
        constructs canonical WikiPaths that based on WikiPage ATTR_TITLE
        attributes from the JCR. This ensures consistent naming. These
        too are cached. The caching is primitive and *should* use EHcache,
        but doesn't yet. It *probably* makes sense to move logic from
        WikiEngine.getFinalPageName (and related code) here, but that
        wasn't a goal for this checkin.

        * As of this build, we have just 2 failing unit tests: one
        XML-RPC test and one DefaultAclManager test. I will add more
        RefManager tests to exercise UUID-based references more thoroughly
        (although the coverage is decent now as it is).

2010-03-08 Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-214

        * Fixed feature that was broken: localized strings needed by
        Dirk's JavaScript works again. The code has also been refactored
        slightly so that it cached rather than having to continually
        hit the disk looking for resource bundles on every request.

2010-03-03 Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-213

        * Removed old URLConstructors. Fixed bug in StripesUrlContructor
        that caused it to exhibit slightly behavior different different
        behavior than DefaultUrlContructor. It now generates URLs identically.
        Method parsePage() was removed from UrlContructor's interface spec.
        (The only URLConstructor implementation is StripesUrlConstructor,
        anyway, it doesn't need to do any page-param parsing because the
        framework takes care of it.)

        * Removed WikiServlet. All of its functionality had been previously
        moved elsewhere, and it was not being used in web.xml either.
        Also removed SpamFilter; the content-inspection package essentially
        replaces it (and is far more flexible).

        * Fixed bug that popped up in Preferences.jsp regarding skin listings.

        * Slightly changed how EditActionBean.edit() works. It now forwards
        directly to the editor JSPs. These JSPs now render EditorLayout.jsp,
        which allows each editor to load its own resources (per mailing
        list discussion). Edit.jsp's contents essentially morph into
        EditorLayout.jsp.

        * Fixed bug that caused ReferenceManager tests to fail.

2010-02-28 Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-212

        * Exceptions caught by WikiTagBase (and subclass tags) are now
        re-thrown so that they propagate upstream. Previously, doCatch()
        was swallowing them, which made for "interesting" JSP debugging.

        * Edit.jsp, Wiki.jsp, and PageInfo.jsp changed to put the
        edit tab on the right. For editing, the live-preview feature was
        moved to a new "Preview" tab, also on the right. The View tab
        now simply displays the most recent save.

        * The Error.jsp references were made consistent in all JSPs.
        Rather than use JSTL syntax (which won't evaluate when used
        with <% page errorPage %> tag), the references now all use
        /Error.jsp, which itself jsp:includes the template JSP
        Error.jsp using JSTL. This makes the error page customizable
        per-template, but still very easy to use.

        * Cleaned out all of the deadwood in TemplateManager.
        Deprecated IncludeResourcesTag and RequestResourceTag. Resources
        can (and should) be included directly in template JSPs.

        * Small changes to Admin/AdministerProfiles action beans as part
        of a gradual overhaul to the Admin JSPs, which are being Stripesed.

2010-02-28 Dirk Frederickx <brushed@apache.org>

        * v3.0.0-svn-211 : line up with latest template/stripes changes

        * JSPWIKI-429:  Upgrade of Slimbox (viewer for attachments), 
          and adjust it to v3.X of JSPWiki. Various media formats are now
          supported so you can view youtube or facebook videos, other
          wikipages, or even external web-pages.
          Still working on a use as inline media viewer. (iso popup viewer)

        * JSPWIKI-431 Multi-file upload is now supported with Stripes backend.
          (improved gui)
          You can add or remove files (upto 5) before you press the upload 
          button. All attachments are uploaded with the same change note.

        * JSPWIKI-362 - (still experimental) Added an wysiwyg editor to JSPWiki,
          based on mooeditable. (MIT license) 
          This is a light-weight editor, based on mootools. 
          Future extensions will improve integration with JSPWiki
          e.g. adding ajax based suggestion-menu, attachment previews, etc...
          Interaction with Stripes back-end needs more work. 

        * Fixed and simplified the %%category style to work with the stripes
          ViewActionBean.ajaxCategories(). This replaces the AJAXCategories.jsp.

        * Upgrade to mootools-core to 1.2.4, mootools-more to 1.2.4.4

        * Updated %%prettify style, adding line numbers to code-blocks.


2010-01-06 Harry Metske <metskem@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-210
        
        * fixed a couple of Plugin unit tests (support for wiki spaces is
          not yet there), only the ReferringPagesPlugin still fails.
        
2010-02-27 Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-209

        * Moved top-level Error.jsp into the templates directory.

        * Slight tweaks to the admin pages, which are being re-organized.
        Security config is now one of the tabs on Admin.jsp. User
        management partially re-worked but not yet functional.

2010-02-23 Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-208

        * Useful tweaks to the AJAX-related Stripes JavaScript. The
        client-side JavaScript now injects validation errors and messages
        that were generated server-side by an EventResolution, using the same
        prefixes and headers defined in CoreResources for "normal" JSP
        validation errors and messages. Generation of an EventResolution
        for AJAX methods that generate errors is automatic when the
        event method is annotated with @AjaxEvent. Practically speaking,
        what it means is this: to call an Stripes method via Ajax, just
        annotate the method with @AjaxEvent. Then, client-side scripts
        need only call the JavaScript function Stripes.submitFormEvent().
        The rest is MAGIC.
 
        * Captcha interface gains an isEnabled() method to allow
        SpamProtect tag to check whether the CAPTCHA is operational
        before generating output. This is required in stand-alone or
        testing scenarios where an outbound network connection cannot
        be assumed.

        * Moved the admin-related JSPs to the templates directory.
        Added a new layout JSP, StaticLayout.jsp, that is used with
        template JSPs that do not need dynamic content, such as
        Install.jsp. Among other things, this allows admin-related
        JSPs to look more like ordinary pages, and use the same CSS.

        * Tweaked TemplateManager to make the "resource resolver" initialize
        safely even when the WikiEngine does not. This means the 'templates'
        JSTL scripting variable can be used everywhere, for example in
        Install.jsp, Error.jsp or any pages that must load safely.
        
        * Moved all images in top-level /images directory to template
        /images dir, and made code/JSP changes to make sure they can
        be "found" as needed by the TemplateManager resource resolver.

2010-02-20 Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-207

        * Fixed 2 failing Scandic page-name URL generation tests. Page names are now
        encoded as UTF-8. Also patched Group- PageName- and PrincipalTypeConverter
        to ensure that incoming parameters are properly decoded, which they
        were not before. Added a Scandic page-name test to ViewActionBeanTest.

        * [JSPWIKI-510] Restored AJAX quicksearch. It now respects page ACLs, too.
        Moved the AJAX "suggestions" method to (new) EditDialogActionBean,
        which is a placeholder for now. Removed JSON global bridge from
        SearchManager.

        * [JSPWIKI-635] Disabled the snip-editor feature that was interfering
        with editor form submission and causing double postings. This is a crude
        hack until Dirk is able to look at the root cause more closely. :)

        * [JSPWIKI-180] Removed ISO-8859-1 support from ExternalDiffProvider,
        WikiEngine, AbstractFileProvider, TestEngine and a few tests.

        * Fixed multiple bugs in Preferences and Preferences.jsp. Asserted names
        were not being set when "save prefs" button was pushed. PreferencesLocalePicker
        was not correctly matching incoming browser Locales to those available on
        the server. Time zones were not correctly being set. Preferences also had
        a static-method fetish, which was unnatural. It has been refactored
        completely and thoroughly.

        * [JSPWIKI-382] Removed posteditor. Moved Stripes AJAX function to
        jspwiki-common.js. Light cleanup of unneeded functions in prefs/edit JS.

2010-02-14 Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-206

        * Fixed bug in TemplateResolution that prevented some JSPs from resolving.

        * Installed StripesURLContructor as the default (and only) URL constructor.
        URLs are constructed according to the @UrlBinding annotations in the
        ActionBeans. Because of the checkins svn-201 through -203, the generated
        URLs are identical to the ones previously generated by DefaultURLConstructor
        (with one or two exceptions are previously noted). In the Beta timeframe,
        the FileBasedActionResolver will allow URL bindings to be externalized.
        The other URLConstructors will be removed before Beta... but not today.

        * Changed a few classes that depend on Stripes to use "lazy
        initialization." WikiContextFactory and StripesURLConstructor
        must lazily initialize because they depend on StripesFilter
        being initialized first. Cleaned up TestEngine also: it now
        initializes a full mock Stripes filter stack at startup.
        
        * Eliminated WikiRuntimeConfiguration: it is no longer needed
        because WikiEngine can easily be obtained without needing
        a special Stripes config class. Less classes are always better.
        
        * Renamed ShortUrlRedirectFilter to ShortUrlFilter.

2010-02-12 Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-205
        
        * Introduced TemplateResolution, which forwards the user to
        the appropriate resource in /templates/<template>. It replaces
        the use of ForwardResolution in most of the ActionBeans.
        For example, to forward to a template JSP ("display JSP"),
        you'd do this: new TemplateResolution( "PageInfo.jsp" ).
        JSPWiki will figure out where the template JSP actually
        is, and forward to the correct path.
        
        * Fixed some minor bugs and a few failing unit tests.
        
        * Removed two unnecessary JARs: jsp-api.jar and servlet-api.jar.
        These don't seem to be needed, but please re-add them if I
        am mistaken.

2010-02-07 Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-204

        * Refactored WikiBackgroundThread to operate as listeners
        for JMX timer events. Because they are no longer true threads
        they don't keep chewing up heap if context shutdown for some
        reason isn't normal.

        * Fixed some small bugs in SessionMonitor and Preferences.

        * Replaced the last few wiki:include tags with jsp:include,
        and deprecated WikiIncludeTag.

2010-02-04 Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-203

        * [JSPWIKI-578] Eliminated the remaining top-level JSPs
        except for Error.jsp. Minor tweaks to the
        templates/default directory; the layout JSP and
        related JSPs are in their own layout/subdirectory.

2010-02-02 Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-202

        * [JSPWIKI-578] Eliminated top-level JSPs for Edit.jsp,
        Preview.jsp, CreateProfile.jsp, Login.jsp, LoginForm.jsp,
        LostPassword.jsp, and UserPreferences.jsp and consolidated
        the markup into the template JSPs.

        * Preview is now a tab, and its contents refresh automatically
        when it is clicked based on the editor's contents.
        This replaces "live" or "sneak" preview. It looks good
        and works well. Related: a new EventResolution class
        now exists to help events methods return AJAX that
        stripes-support.js understands.
        
        * TabbedSectionTag gains an onclick() attribute that
        passes contents through to the underlying <div>. This
        feature is super-useful and enables the new preview
        functionality. Refactored TabTag to make it simpler.

        * Moved injection of JSTL variables ${wikiEngine}
        and ${wikiSession} to SessionMonitor, so that they
        are always present even if Stripes isn't involved.

        * Fixed a bug in TemplateManager that was preventing
        resources underneath the top-level templates directory
        from being found.

2010-01-30 Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-201 aka the JSP Consolidation Checkin

        * [JSPWIKI-578] Eliminated top-level JSPs for Wiki.jsp,
        PageInfo.jsp, Diff.jsp, Delete.jsp and Attachments.jsp.
        The relevant ActionBeans are still bound to these URLs
        (except PageInfo.jsp), but there are no longer physical
        JSPs for these top-level paths. The template JSPs in
        /templates/default now contain all of the formatting
        and markup and are mostly HTML and JSTL. At the moment,
        ActionBeans all forward to to hard-wired template JSP
        paths in /templates/default. A "TemplateResolution"
        class that makes forwards dynamic based on the current
        template will come a little later.

        * Added convenience accessors getHistory() and
        getAttachments() to AbstractPageActionBean so that
        subclasses can inherit them. This also means template JSPs
        now have easy JSTL access to page history and attachments.

        * Added option to PageTimeComparator to allow descending
        order sorts, used by AbstractPageActionBean. Also replaced
        several spurious uses of the default constructor that
        should have used the static instance instead.

        * Fixed bug in AttachmentActionBean that prevented the
        size of uploaded attachments from being seen.

        * Fixed bug in DeleteActionBean that prevented attachments
        from being deleted properly.

        * Fixed bug in EditActionBean that prevented the author from
        being correctly set when the user was already authenticated.

        * Added methods getCreated() and getChangeNote() to WikiPage
        and JCRWikiPage. Fixed bug in ContentManager that was
        preventing creation and modification times from being
        correctly set upon save.

        * Added new JspFunctions class for convenient "short formatting"
        of file names, ISO8601 date formatting, and the attachments
        tab name (localized). These replace scriptlet code formerly
        located in the old top-level Wiki.jsp and elsewhere. For example,
        to output an ISO8601 date, JSPs can simply use a JSTL expression
        like this: "${wiki:iso8601date(att.lastModified)}".

        * TabTag now accepts two new attributes, which can be used
        in place of the "url" attribute: "beanclass" and "event".
        These are used to specify ActionBean names and event, and
        are used in the same manner as <stripes:link>. TabTag
        also now accepts child <wiki:param> tags to make this easier.

2010-01-21 Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-200

        * WikiServletFilter's sole remaining function (checking for
        cookie and container authentication) was moved into
        WikiInterceptor and WikiContextFactory. WikiServletFilter
        was removed.

        * Moved ErrorActionBean functions into MessageActionBean.
        
        * The admin/Admin.jsp JSP receives the Stripes treatment, but
        badly. It doesn't work and will need to be fixed.
        
        * All top-level JSPs have now been converted to Stripes
        ActionBeans. No scriptlet code remains. Some scriptlets
        remain in the template JSPs, but that is ok. ViewTemplate.jsp
        and EditTemplate.jsp are removed.

2010-01-17 Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-199

        * SecurityConfig gets the Stripes treatment. Minor
        tweaks to SecurityVerifier to make it JSTL-friendly.
        SecurityConfig logic moves to AdminActionBean.
        Minor licensing doc tweaks per [JSPWIKI-544].

2010-01-09 Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-198

        * Checked in PasswordChallenge, which renders the
        input for the <SpamProtect challenge="password">
        option. CAPTCHA added to CreateProfile.jsp.

2010-01-08 Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-197

        * Minor renaming of a few content-inspection types
        and methods. Added default weights for the content
        inspectors to jspwiki.properties. Removed the listener
        code from the Inspection class. The code was good
        and it worked nicely, but it is no longer needed due
        to the way we integrate CAPTCHA now. We can always
        add listeners back if we have to, but in the
        meantime: a simpler API is a better API.

2010-01-06 Harry Metske <metskem@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-196
        
        * got rid of a bunch of JavaDoc warnings
        
        * minor tweaks to build.xml (JSPWIKI-620), webtests
          don't work yet => future work
        
2010-01-06 Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-195

        * Minor refactoring to content-inspection package to
        better support multi-field inspections.

        * Second of three CAPTCHA checkins. CAPTCHA is now treated
        as a form validation problem. By default, CAPTCHA is
        now dynamic, and is displayed only when the content
        inspector says a form POST contains spam. Added i18n
        support for Asirra.
        
        * Minor changes to SpamProtectTag. Now accepts a
        "challenge" attribute, which can have the value
        "captcha" or "password," which will cause a challenge
        of that type to always be rendered, even on first
        display. (We will use this for new user account
        registration, for example.)
        
        * I plan one or two more checkins to the content-inspection
        and CAPTCHA code: to remove some over-engineered stuff,
        provide a configuration UI, implement a password
        challenge, and clean up a few things.

2009-12-27 Harry Metske <metskem@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-194
        
        * upgrade priha 0.6.1 => 0.7.0-alpha

2009-12-21 Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-193

        * CAPTCHA has been re-written. It has been integrated into
        the new content-inspection system and is pluggable. ActionBean
        event handler methods that need CAPTCHA can simply add
        (1) a @SpamProtect annotation to the method declaration
        anf (2) a <wiki:SpamProtect/> tag inside the corresponding
        JSP <s:form> or <form> elements. Unlike the old Captcha.jsp
        (which is eliminated), the new system adds CAPTCHA elements
        right onto the form that is being protected (via the
        SpamProtect tag). The new Captcha interface specifies the
        contract that implementations must fulfill. One CAPTCHA
        implementation is provided, AsirraCaptcha. ReCaptcha is
        likely, and will come later. More polish (i18n, CSS, JSP
        formatting, Install configuration) is is needed, but the
        current checkin works now, and will get us started. I intend
        to add dynamic CAPTCHA at a later point (e.g., less
        trustworthy users always get a CAPTCHA to start, etc).

2009-12-15 Harry Metske <metskem@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-192
        
        * JSPWIKI-618: Allow Administrators to override attachment.maxsize  (reported by Jurgen Weber)

2009-12-11 Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-191.

        * Workflow/WorkflowContent.jsp received the Stripes treatment.
        All logic moved to WorkflowActionBean.
        
        * Fixed some dumb license header issues.

2009-12-10 Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-190. Unit test fixes. Back up to 97.3% pass rate.
        Page-renaming, references and related plugins are still messed up,
        but the stuff I messed up a few checkins ago is fixed. 

2009-12-03 Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-189
        
        * JSPWIKI-616: WikiPageEvent now takes in a WikiPath instead of
        String.

        * 3.0.0-svn-188
        
        * Fixed ContentManager.checkin() to use a separate Session for
        copying - it had an off-by-one error when storing the old version.
        This fixes quite a few tests...
        
2009-12-01 Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-187
        
        * Bug fix: ContentManager.deleteVersion() no longer restores
        the page (as empty) after deletion.  Oops.  (Technically,
        JCRWikiPage.getJCRNode() was creating the page instead of throwing
        an exception.)
        
        * Deprecated WikiEngine.getPureText() [use WikiPage.getContentAsString()
        instead.]
        
        * ContentManager.deleteVersion() fires a NODE_SAVED instead of NODE_DELETED,
        since deletion implies removal of the entire page.
        
2009-11-28 Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-186
        
        * ContentManager.isNew() was checking if ATTR_CREATED exists
        after it had ensured it had one to determine whether page is new
        or not. Oops.
        
        * More fixes to ContentManager.checkin() and save() as it was
        accidentally creating old pages with wrong version numbers, which
        in turn caused deletions to fail in some places.
        
2009-11-27 Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-185

        * Significantly re-worked GroupActionBean and related JSPs.
        Event handlers save and saveNew were combined. Message keys
        were moved and/or renamed to make the *GroupContent.jsp pages
        simpler.

        * NewBlogEntry.jsp received the Stripes treatment; its logic
        moved to EditActionBean.blog().
        
        * rss.jsp received the Stripes treatment; its logic moved
        to RSSActionBean.rss(). ** not fully tested yet **.
        SisterSites.jsp logic also moved to RSSActionBean.sisterSites().
        
        * Default template AJAXCategories.jsp logic moved to
        ViewActionBean.ajaxCategories(). AJAXPreview.jsp logic moved
        to EditActionBean.ajaxPreview(). Script files jspwiki-common.js
        and jspwiki-edit.js were slightly tweaked.
        ** not fully tested yet **
        
        * LineDelimitedTypeConverter was changed to handle linefeeds
        and comma-delimited text strings equally. So far, only
        EditGroup.jsp uses this feature.
        
        * The trunk is still more broken that it should be.

2009-11-26 Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-184
        
        * wiki:title was not properly copied upon rename operation.
        
        * checkin() did not properly bump the version number when saving,
        resulting in versions being in the history, but all with version 0.
        
2009-11-26 Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-183
        
        * Added wiki:title attribute to carry the case correctly so
        that we're no longer relying on the WikiPath for the title.
        
        * Sped up ReferenceManager by insisting not calling save() on
        every occasion.  We still should probably not call save() at all
        and do it at the end of any event handling.
        
2009-11-25 Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-182 aka "the Thanksgiving Turkey build"

        * EditActionBean received significant tweaks. Page-conflict
        logic got stuffed into EditActionBean, and PageModifiedActionBean
        went down the gullet as a result. Commenting is now fully baked;
        it now uses Stripes.
        
        * Diff.jsp received the Stripes treatment.

        * SisterSites received the Stripes treatment. We didn't need
        to do it just yet. It's all just gravy at this point in the release cycle.

        * Fans of bad wordplay are invited to blow cranberries
        -- I mean, rasberries -- in my general direction.


2009-11-24 Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-181
        
        * Added first iteration of import code, which works with 2.8.4-svn-3. Known
        problems: Attachments are not yet imported. Existence of ACLs breaks code.
        
        * WikiPath is now case-insensitive in equals() to support proper wikipage
        case-insensitiveness.

2009-11-21 Harry Metske <metskem@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-180
        
         * JSPWIKI-612: fix UserManagement.jsp 's option in user select box 
         (I like to add the name of the person who discovered this bug, but
         the codepage ISO8859-1 doesn't allow that)
       
2009-11-14 Harry Metske <metskem@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-179
        
        * JSPWIKI-608, EditActionBean should not warn for page.lock after preview
        
        * some CoreResources files had no value for assertedName, causing a weird Preferences page
        
2009-11-14 Harry Metske <metskem@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-178
        
        * placeholders in edit.locked i18n key were not properly numbered in some languages
        
        * EditActionBean's property changeNote changed to changenote (Stripes could't find it)
        
        * EditActionBean now uses it's own setters for member vars.
        
        * minor typo in ChangeRateInspector 
        
2009-11-03 Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-177

        * Fixed bug causing concatenation of edited page text.
        Root cause: over-eager use of flash-scope in EditActionBean.
        Upgraded Stripes to 1.6-beta.

2009-11-01 Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-176

        * Fixed bug in ContentManager.pageExists() that caused tests
        for version 1 of pages to fail if there had been no other
        versions saved yet. Shockingly, we had never tested for this
        condition before. As a result, webapp page-viewing actions
        now work again. Related: added versioning to ViewActionBean,
        which hadn't been added previously because the versioning
        code hadn't stabilized until recently.

2009-10-26 Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@apache.org>

        * Priha 0.6.0, no other changes.  This new version functions
        correctly also on case-insensitive file systems.
        
2009-10-27 Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-175

        * Tweaked the svn:ignore property for the etc/ and tests/etc/
        directories. This should allow the trunk .xml files to
        update working copies properly.

        * Fixed Janne's slightly dodgy LDAP-server-existence-checking
        code. ;)  Tweaked unit test names and order to match the command
        line (ant tests) version. Removed redundant 2nd execution of
        TextUtilTest inside its package's AllTests class, and added
        in the ui.stripes.AllTests suite. These two changes mean that
        all 3 test methods: guitests, tests, and Eclipse all report
        1024 tests. Eclipse tests show a classpath error in
        HtmlStringToWikiTranslatorTest that is throwing 14 errors.
        I'm too tired at this point to fix this. Other than that,
        we are cleaner than Janne's baby's bottom after a diaper change.
        That is to say, not perfect but perfectly presentable.
        
        * Now, on to the JSP and War issues...

2009-10-26 Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-174

        * Added code to test harness to check for existence of LDAP server
        before trying to execute tests.
        
        * Introduced JSPWikiTestBase which testcases should extend if
        they wish to throw NotExecutableExceptions.
        
2009-10-26 Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-173

        * Fixed single last unit test bug. Although LDAP tests won't work
        if a test LDAP server isn't running, all other unit tests run
        100% clean. This is the first time that has happened in at
        least a year. Test times: 7 minutes 51 seconds for 1024 tests.

        * Added Ant script to start OpenLDAP test fixture if
        available.

        * Fixed JCRWikiPage bug that was causing JCR exceptions when
        attributes were not set. 

2009-10-25 Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-172

        * Upgraded Priha to 0.5.5. Fixed several unit tests that broke as
        a result. Note that Priha is now *extremely* sensitive to incomplete
        shutdowns of JCR, particularly in unit tests. Unit tests *must*
        be very sure to call WikiEngine.shutdown() every time a WikiEngine
        is started up. Also, removed XML schema (not needed any more).

2009-10-25 Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-171

        * Additional build.xml tweaks to fix broken WAR builds.

2009-10-24 Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-170
        
        * Restructured "tests" Ant target so that all test fixtures used
        during the tests itself are now in build/tests. The original files
        used to construct the fixtures stay in tests/etc, but nothing in
        tests/etc are used when running the tests. The build/tests dir
        contains classes, classpath (copied from tests/etc), db (copied
        from etc/db), priha (the test page repository), reports (for
        JUnit test results) and workdir. The logfile for tests is now
        build/tests/jspwiki.log. In addition to these changes,
        the Ant tasks "init" and "tests-init" are now hooked into the
        Eclipse "clean" and "build project" commands as external builders.
        These ensure that the same test fixtures are set up if run from
        Eclipse.
        
2009-10-17 Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-169

        * Reverted previous fix to lone failing JSPWikiMarkupParserTest
        and added checks into ContentManager.addPage() that recycles
        Nodes that haven't been saved yet. This fixes the edge-case
        bug that the failing test uncovered: a caller that created
        a particular WikiPage twice via addPage() -- without calling
        WikiPage.save() in between invocations -- created a
        same-named-sibling (SNS) in JCR. Instead of doing this, we
        simply re-use this Node in the returned WikiPage. 

2009-10-17 Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-168
        
        * All but three tests running, 99.71%. The last three seem to be Priha-related.
        
2009-10-14 Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-167
        
        * All unit tests except four run successfully. These all relate
        to page-renaming, and should yield after a bit more gentle persuasion.

2009-10-14 Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-166

        * We are getting damned close to a nice clean build. 98%+

2009-10-14 Harry Metske <metskem@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-165
        
        * A bunch of (nl) i18n work.
        
2009-10-13 Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-164

        * Additional unit test fixes. Pass rate is now over 97% when LDAP test
        harness running. Checked in Priha 0.5.2.

2009-10-13 Harry Metske <metskem@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-163
        
        TestEngine.emptyWorkdir() was only emptying the workdir if the
        workdir contains a file called "refmgr.ser" (dunno why), causing the 
        PageViewPluginTest to fail.
        Got rid of a bunch of error messages in the log by adding 
        engine.shutdown() statements to testcases.
        Still a lot Stripes messages "..Configuration object cannot be located.."
        remaining.
        
2009-10-11 Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-162

        * Many unit test fixes. Minor tweaks to Inspector classes.
        Implemented ContentManager.pageExists() for versions; the
        lack of this feature was causing several tests to fail.
        When LDAP test harness is running, overall test scores
        are back up to 96%.
        
        * Comment.jsp receives the Stripes treatment (initial checkin;
        not fully tested yet).

2009-10-09 Juan Pablo Santos <juanpablo AT apache DOT org>

        * updated es translation (no version bump).

2009-10-07 Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-161
        
        * First checkin of new content-inspection package, designed to
        refactor SpamFilter functions into a series of stacked Inspector
        classes that can analyze and score content in multiple ways,
        including for spam detection. See the package.html and Javadocs
        for detailed descriptions on the API design. These features will
        be used by ANY and ALL ActionBeans to allow for spam filtering
        via the @SpamProtect annotation and SpamProtect JSP tag. Three
        notable limitations of this checkin: 1) no CAPTCHA integration
        yet; 2) Comment.jsp is temporarily broken; 3) User registration
        not hooked into content inspection just yet. All will be addressed
        soon.
        
        * Plain editor and related bundle messages slightly refactored to
        make the JSP markup more concise and logical. Certain JavaScript
        hooks are broken; I'll need to work with Dirk to fix this.
        
        * Bug fix: Ant schema-checking no longer requires a web connection
        because we include all the needed schema in the local build. Yay!
        
        * General Javadoc and minor test tweaks.
        
2009-09-27 Dirk Frederickx <brushed@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-160 - fixed illegal char in jspwiki-common.js.
        Failed on yui compressor.

2009-09-26 Harry Metske <metskem@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-159
        
        * added a few missing i18n keys (English and Dutch)
        
        * removed invalid char from WikiPageFormatter causing compile warnings
        
        * typo in CheckVersionTag
        
        * upgrade priha 0.1.32 => 0.3.2
        
2009-09-26 Dirk Frederickx <brushed@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-158 - upgrade mootools library

        * Upgraded the mootools library to the latest stable version v1.2.3.
        JSPWiki now includes the mootools-core.js and a selection of the
        mootools-more.js. 
        All js routines were updated.  But expect some stuff still to be broken.

        * JSPWIKI-600: javascript error on getCoordinates()
        Now OK with mootools v1.2.3
        
        * JSPWIKI-591: # sign behind headlines is now hidden on the printed wiki page

        * Added unit test on Javascript.
        The JSSPec unit tests were ported to the Jasmine
        testing framework (http://github.com/pivotal/jasmine)
        with a *compatible* MIT license.
        Simply open /tests/javascript/jasmine-runner.html to execute the tests.

        * The print css stylesheet is now included in the standard jspwiki.css
        (@media print) to reduce download time.

        * All javascript handlers are removed from the JSP's. (unobtrusive js)
        All submit/click handlers are not installed from the javascript
       at the time of the page-load.

       * Aligned the javascript names of the UserPreferences cookies with 
       the new names used by the org.apache.wiki.preferences class.
       Cookie handling seems not yet 100% ok.
       
       * Several tweaks on AttachementInfoTab.jsp and AttachmentTab.jsp.
       
       * Few small tweaks on Preferences and EditorManager on the handling of the
       UserPreferences. However, still several bugs to be fixed.


2009-09-16 Harry Metske <metskem@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-157
        
        * JSPWIKI-601: lastModified dates were not shown in page versions, replaced 
        prefs.DateFormat with prefs.TimeFormat on multiple places.
        Also attachment created dates were not shown (attachments don't have
        a lastModified date, but a created Date).

2009-09-12 Harry Metske <metskem@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-156
        
        * JSPWIKI-595: Fixed EditActionBean to set the ChangeNote
        when saving a page.
        
        * Fixed a bunch of JavaDoc errors and CheckStyle warnings
        
        * Added more error logging to JCRWikiPage
        
2009-09-13 Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-155

        * Fixed bug preventing re-init of Priha repository after installation.
        "Instant install" using Priha for JCR, and LDAP or XML for auth/user
        storage now works as expected.

        * The "superuser" (su) feature has been implemented. This user can do anything,
        and can log in even when the UserManager is not working. The password is
        hashed and stored in jspwiki.properties.

        * Fixed WikiSession/SessionMonitor caching problem that was preventing
        logins after "instant install" WikiEngine restarts.

        * Fixed bug in JCRWikiPage preventing attachments from being listed.
        Attachment uploads and downloads work again.
        
        * Fixed Parser/Renderer bug that made them allergic to WikiContexts that
        do not have "pages" (e.g., UserPreferences). Because WikiContexts are
        *not* guaranteed to have pages in 3.0, this was important to fix.
        Fixed related bug in TranslateTag; we now render the body content by calling
        RenderingManager directly, rather than inefficiently channeling it through
        WikiEngine (and looking up nonexistent cached documents, etc.).

        * Fiddly tweaks to make bunches of compiler warnings/verification errors
        go away.

        * Upgraded Stripes to 1.5.2-beta, which fixes an important layout bug.
        Added a WikiPageFormatter class that will render WikiPage objects passed
        to Stripes tags as the page name, rather than contents of toString().
        
        * SearchBox and a few other JSPs received the Stripes forms-tag treatment.

2009-09-12 Harry Metske <metskem@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-154
        
        * JSPWIKI-598: Fixed EditActionBean to also release the PageLock
        after saving a page.
        * Fixed a few checkstyle warnings 
        
2009-09-08 Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-153

        * Fixing a few stray bugs, and a bit of tidying up: resource
        bundles, comments, method names, etc.
        
2009-09-07 Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-152

        * [JSPWIKI-599]: fixed NPEs in DefaultWikiContext.

        * Fixed bug in CommentedProperties.

        * Install.jsp received the Stripes treatment and moved to
        admin/Installer.jsp. Key new features include the ability to
        configure and test LDAP user/role lookups dynamically via
        AJAX. Additional security configuration enhancements
        are planned, for example JavaMail live config/testing.
        InstallActionBean also features "instant setup" --
        changes can be applied WITHOUT restarting the webapp.

        * On a related note, WikiEngine gains a new method restart()
        which does what you'd imagine. InstallActionBean relies
        on restart() to make "instant setup" possible.

        * As a result of the new install process, certain
        non-public functions moved from WikiServletFilter into
        WikiInterceptor.
        
        * Fixed small bugs in Ldap support code and
        added sample keychain to tests/etc.

2009-09-06 Harry Metske <metskem@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-151
        
        * JSPWIKI-597: Upgrade yuicompressor from 2.3.3 to 2.4.2 to solve 
        RuntimeExceptions when using OpenJDK.

2009-08-30 Harry Metske <metskem@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-150
        
        * Introduced the new PageViewPlugin written by Andre van Dalen.
        This plugin counts page views and presents the statistics on page views
        See http://www.jspwiki.org/wiki/PageViewPlugin for the complete
        documentation.
        A bit of i18n work for the translators too.....
        
        * a bit less verbosity in ReferenceManager.checkValueString(), 
        we now only dump the illegal page name instead of dumping a stacktrace.
        
2009-08-30 Dirk Frederickx <brushed@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-149 - align with 2.8.3-svn-16
                
        * JSPWIKI-577: tabbed sections with many tabs with long names will float the 
        tabs to a next line. Fixed the 'jumping' behavior of clicking this wide tabs,
        which was caused by a superfluous bottom-border css style.

        * Open/Close of collapsible boxes is now only possible by clicking the +/- icon.
        Any clicks on the header-bar will not change the status of the 
        collapsible box anymore. E.G. in the Info tab, when looking at page 
        differences between 2 versions, you can now click the version drop-downs
        without changing the status of the collapsible box.

        * Implemented the standard css overflow treatment of the 'diff' body. Horizontal 
        scroll-bars will only be shown when looking at wide content.
        This is the same overflow treatment as the page content.

2009-08-25 Dirk Frederickx <brushed@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-148
        
        * JSPWIKI-580: Fixing the quirky handling of the textarea selection range
        in IEx browsers.
        

2009-08-23 Harry Metske <metskem@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-147
        
        * removed author check from PluginManagerTest (as a result
          of removing author field from ModuleDate)
          
        * get rid of annoying compile warnings about "unmappable character
          for encoding UTF8" in ReferenceManagerTest, now using 
          Unicode escape sequences 

2009-08-23 Harry Metske <metskem@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-146
        
        * JSPWIKI-589 Removed all @author tags from source files
          and added contributor names to README
          
2009-08-23 Harry Metske <metskem@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-145
          
        * corrected propname in build.properties : 
           war.compile.jsps => compile.jsps
           
        * added dummy SimpleCredentials login to ContentManager.newSession()
          this is required since priha 0.1.25 (not sure if this is the 
          right place/approach but at least we can run our JUnit tests again,
          although still many tests fail (92.15%))
          
        * upgrade priha : 0.1.30 => 0.1.32

2009-08-19 Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-144

        * LDAP support for user databases, authentication and authorization
        has landed in the trunk. It has been tested with Active Directory
        and OpenLDAP, and is customizable for other LDAP servers. See
        jspwiki.properties for more details. Note that a user-accessible
        way of configuring the "Keychain" for storing bind DN passwords
        is still not available, but will be coming soon in a revamped
        installer screen. LdapLoginModule was removed, because it's actually
        much cleaner to use the UserDatabaseLoginModule instead.

2009-08-19 Harry Metske <metskem@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-143
        
        * upgrade priha : 0.1.22 => 0.1.30
        
        * recovered ChangeLog

2009-08-19 Dirk Frederickx <brushed@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-142

        * JSPWIKI-576. Styles of section [Edit] links fixed for IE.

        * JSPWIKI-585: Scrollbars on wide-pages fixed for FF and Safari (overflow-y:hidden) and IE.
        
        * JSPWIKI-383, JSPWIKI-481: Support redirecting back to special pages suchs as 
        the Search page, Workflow page.
        
2009-08-16 Harry Metske <metskem@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-141
        
        * got rid of a bunch of Javadoc and compile warnings
        
        * added an extra error(String, Throwable) method to the Logger interface.
          When we switched to the varargs interfaces we lost the (log4j) 
          option to automagically dump the stacktrace with the exception.
          WikiEngine's initialize method now uses this new method, so we 
          can better diagnose problems with new features and things like
          JackRabbit.

2009-08-15 Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-140

        * Checked in LdapUserDatabase, and refactorings to other LDAP
        classes. The LdapUserDatabase is read-only. ProfileTab will
        respect this and will print, rather than allow edits to, user
        profile information as a result. Any UserDatabase can now be
        flagged as "read-only" (via jspwiki.properties) to achieve
        the same effect. 

2009-08-08 Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-139

        * Checked in revised LdapLoginModule and LdapAuthorizer. Notable new
        features include provisional support for Active Directory, which
        "mostly" works. I also added the ability to bind to LDAP with a
        specified identity. To to this, we use a new feature of
        freshcookies-security called a "keychain" that stores the binding
        DN in an password-locked, triple-DES encrypted file. The keychain
        is available via AuthenticationManager.getKeychain() and can be
        used for storage of anything sensitive. The keychain is NOT required
        to be unlocked at startup time (although obviously LDAP binds will
        fail). We will provide the ability for the admin to unlock the
        keychain via the web UI in a future build.  

2009-07-29 Harry Metske <metskem@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-138
        
        * fixed two minor JUnit tests (DenouncePlugin and CommentedProperties)
          the last one by removing the license from test.properties (should be OK)
          
        * removed OSCache reference from SisterSites.jsp

2009-07-23 Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-137
        
        * Switched from OSCache to EhCache to provide better performance
        (and remove one extra JAR from the distro).  RenderingManagerTest
        performance goes up 50%...

2009-07-23 Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-136
        
        * Improved LoggerFactory not to fail horribly when the SLF4J
        bridge classes were missing.
        
        * Installed default priha and log4j config files to WEB-INF/classes
        
2009-07-23 Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-135
        
        * Moved some classes from the top-level package to better places.
        For example, JCRWikiPage => org.apache.wiki.content.jcr; 
        ReferenceManager => org.apache.wiki.content.
        
        * PageNameResolvers now have their own package under .content.
        
        * Also moved around some test classes to their proper packages.
        
2009-07-23 Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-134
        
        * First LDAP support classes checked in. We support an LdapLoginModule
        and LdapAuthorizer. Both are configured via jspwiki.properties
        and should be considered experimental. Significant limitations at the
        moment include the assumption that role searches are done ONLY via
        anonymous bind. We support OpenLDAP, but not Active Directory (yet).
        The LdapUserDatabase implementation won't come for a while, either.

2009-07-22 Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-133
        
        * First implementation of versioning implemented.  Almost all
        of the WikiEngine unit tests now run, though some of the old ones
        were removed.  Please see doc/README - JCR Changes.txt for details
        about the versioning implementation.
        
2009-06-07 Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-132
        
        * JSPWIKI-545: Fixed hopefully the last of the RAT issues.
        
        * Removed generation of jspwiki_rcs and jspwiki_vers.properties
        from unit tests, since they are no longer used.
        
2009-06-21 Dirk Frederickx <brushed AT apache DOT org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-131
        
        * Fixed Quick Navigation drop down menu position.
        
        * Fixed the overflow handling of wide pages. (eg pages with wide
        preformatted content or wide images)

        * Fixed the location of the favicon.ico.
        
        * Fixed the insertion of 'jslocalizationstring' and 'jsfunction',
        which were missing from the DefaultLayout.jsp.
        
        * Fixed the formatting of the search detail fragments in FindContent.jsp.

2009-06-14 Dirk Frederickx <brushed AT apache DOT org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-130
        
        * Checked in new versions of jspwiki-common.js, jpswiki-edit.js 
        and jspwiki.css. 
        Extensive documentation has been added to the javascript and css
        files, although not complete yet.
        The jspwiki-edit.js has been updated to replace posteditor.js. Expect
        still some loose ends though.  The plain editor has a new simplified
        toolbar, but this is still work in progress.
        
        * Updated the js ajax routines to better fit with new the stripes approach.
        FindContents.jsp is now dynamically updating search results.
        The jsonrpc javascript is still unchanged.


2009-06-11 Harry Metske <metskem@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-129
        
        * JSPWIKI-545: Fixed a number of RAT issues again. I guess we
        are done now, please check.
        
2009-06-07 Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * Search.jsp migrated to Stripes. SearchActionBean now provides
        searching logic, including an ajaxSearch() method that filters
        results correctly (this is not hooked up to the client JavaScript
        yet, but it should be straightforward to do). Still some i18n
        cleanup to do.

        * Cleanup of a few stray unneeded annotations and imports, and
        Java-fived a few other classes and JSPs.

        * listTimezones/TimeFormats/Locales code moved to Preferences,
        where it belongs. All of these were only called by one method
        anyway, so this was a safe thing to do.

        * Added method TemplateManager.getTemplateResources() that returns
        a Map that resolves requests for -- wait for it -- template
        resources. This Map is injected into the HttpSession as the
        attribute 'templates'. That means that JSPs can now use EL
        expressions like this: ${templates['FindContent.jsp']}, which returns
        the relative path to the correct content JSP. The current template
        takes precedence, followed by the default template. The Map is
        initialized at wiki startup, so it is very efficient.
        In the future, wiki:IncludeTag will be refactored to use this Map.

        * Changed all instances of the stripes: prefix in the JSPs to s:.

        * Fixed bug in BreadCrumbs tag that was causing non-WikiPage contexts
        to appear as page "Main". These contexts are now omitted. Fixed
        related bug where non-WikiPage contexts were causing NPEs in certain
        tags, like FeedDiscovery and PermissionTag.

        * Added doc/JSON Changes.txt that documents important information
        about how AJAX calls will change in 3.0.

2009-06-07 Harry Metske <metskem@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-127
        
        * JSPWIKI-545: Fixed a number of RAT issues (2), more needed still.
        
2009-06-07 Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-126
        
        * JSPWIKI-545: Fixed a number of RAT issues.
        
2009-06-07 Harry Metske <metskem@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-125

        * JSPWIKI-568  jspwiki.propertyfile cannot be defined as system property
        You can now specify a Java System Property jspwiki.propertyfile to specify
        the location of jspwiki.properties (thanks to Piotr Tarnowski) 

2009-06-03 Harry Metske <metskem@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-124

        * JSPWIKI-569  added Brazilian Portuguese translation, thanks to Paulo Amaral 

2009-05-30 Harry Metske <metskem@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-123

        * JSPWIKI-565  add missing package.html files
        
        * moved WikiRPCHandler from org.apache.wiki.xmlrpc to
        org.apache.wiki.rpc (as indicated by the FIXME)
        
        * moved/reorged HexUtils from org.apache.catalina.util to
        org.apache.wiki.util. (org.apache.catalina.util removed)
        
        * fixed a few errors in the NL translation
        
2009-05-29 Harry Metske <metskem@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-122

        * JSPWIKI-564  Comment Editor populated by Preview from another wikipage,
        reported by Jeff Allen.
        The Comment.jsp now always clears the EDITED_TEXT from the session.

2009-05-23  Harry Metske <metskem@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-121
        Minor javadoc corrections and one JUnit test fix
        
2009-05-23  Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-120

        * Minor enhancement to JCRWikiPage: now implements
        getContentAsStream(). Also, Javadocs and field m_name
        tweaked to reflect WikiName-->WikiPath renaming.
        The method getContentType() was pulled up from Attachment
        into the WikiPage interface to prevent need to special-case.

        * Major refactoring of attachment handling. AttachmentServlet
        has been removed in favor of AttachmentActionBean. The Stripes
        DynamicMappingFilter was added to ensure that /attach URLs are
        mapped correctly. Upload URLs are slightly different, but
        download URLs remain the same (and in fact are now path-aware, so
        they support spaces and subpages). AttachmentServlet will be
        removed from the code entirely once AttachmentActionBean is
        better road-tested.

        * Major refactoring of the IteratorTag and its subclasses.
        The new versions are much, much simpler, have zero redundant
        code and are easily extensible. As part of this refactoring,
        direct manipulation of WikiContext state via request attribute
        WikiTagBase.ATTR_CONTEXT is now officially discouraged; use
        WikiContextFactory.saveContext() and
        WikiContextFactory.findContext() instead. Added Javadocs.

        * ReferenceManager: fixed bug where attachments were being
        scanned for wiki links.

        * Fixed bug in WikiActionBeanContext that prevented the correct
        WikiContext from being restored during iteration.

        * WikiPath gains a helpful method, getName(), which returns just
        the portion of the path after the last slash. It works just
        like File.getName(). Reformatted the class also, with JavaDocs
        now fully reflecting rename of WikiName-->WikiPath.

        * Fixed bug in build.xml where JSP-precompiled WARs were not
        being built correctly.

2009-05-18  Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-119

        * Reverted WikiPage.save() so that this method is no longer
        deprecated. Added documentation requiring implementations
        to delegate to ContentManager.save() so that events are
        fired correctly.

        * Added experimental FileBasedActionResolver, which allows
        arbitrary ActionBean URL bindings to be specified in an
        external file. This will allow fully customized URL binding schemes
        to be defined without hard-coding them in the ActionBean
        classes themselves. Currently the configuration file is
        hard-coded as WEB-INF/urlpattern.properties. This restriction
        will be loosened later. FileBasedActionResolver is turned
        off by default.

        * Added experimental ShortUrlRedirectFilter, which intercepts
        URLs written in the "short URL" scheme and redirects them
        to the correct ActionBean URLs. When used in conjunction with
        FileBasedActionResolver, it allows backwards compatibility to
        be preserved with "permalink" short URLs for viewing, while
        freeing up implementors to specify their own completely
        customized URL schemes. This filter is turned off by default.
        So that it can be more easily turned on and off, this may be
        refactored into a Stripes Interceptor later. But for now, it's a
        filter. Murray, this one's for you.
        
        * Supplemental tweaks for JSPWIKI-534.

2009-05-17  Harry Metske <metskem@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-118
        
        * JSPWIKI-534 WikiServletFilter now lazily initializes, so that the
           StripesFilter always init's first. 
           This was necessary for running in Jetty.
           
        * included jasper-runtime-*.jar in the copy-step for preparation in
           running the webtests.
           The webtests still don't work, something selenium-specific that I
           could not find yet. 

2009-05-15  Harry Metske <metskem@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-117
        
        * moved BreadcrumbsTrail code from AbstractPageActionBean 
           to BreadcrumbsTag. This is an intermediate improvement, 
           the definite solution is described in JSPWIKI-533 

2009-05-15  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-116
        
        * Fixed the first PageRenamerTest, which was both expecting page
        names in old format, as well as checking assertNull() on getPage()
        instead of catching PageNotFoundException.  Page renaming
        now actually works, though the tests still need to be fixed.

2009-05-10  Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-115

        * Reviewed and partially applied the remainder of Greg Kable's patches
        [JSPWIKI-528]. The changes to ContentManager, WikiEngine and several
        plugins go further than those specified in the patch, and eliminate the
        wrapping/unwrapping in AbstractFilteredPlugin.filterCollection. Notable
        changes include use of Lists in preference to SortedSets, plus the use
        of Collections.sort(). To do this, WikiPage now extends
        Comparable<WikiPage>, as does JCRWikiPage. To allow pages to be
        returned efficiently in a specified order, ContentManager now has a
        method getAllPages(String,Comparator<WikiPage>).

2009-05-10  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@apache.org>

        * Priha 0.1.16 to address some encoding issues with our unit
        tests (no version bump).

2009-05-09  Harry Metske <metskem@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-114

        * JSPWIKI-528, applied Greg's patches jspwiki-528-Weblog.patch and 
           jspwiki-528-workflow.Step.patch.
           
        * minor javadoc in ContentManager
        
        * fixed PluginManagerTest

2009-05-07  Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-113

        * Fixed various plugins that were broken, particularly AbstractFilteredPlugin
        which did not know now to handle page names without spaces. We treat
        this as meaning the default space. Minor method signature changes from
        Collection to List in WikiEngine and ContentManager. Pass rate is now
        95.5%, not counting the JCR Property-related file issue noted in build 110.

2009-05-05  Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-112
        
        * Minor refactoring of pageExists() in WikiEngine, PageManager (legacy)
        and ContentManager to clarify that a page "exists" if it is present
        in the JCR and it has also been previously saved. Previously, we did not
        consider persistence, only if the page existed in memory in the JCR.
        Page-renaming code in ContentManager is now JCR-optimized (even
        though the renaming tests still all fail).
        
        * Fixed NPE in JCRWikiPage.getLastModified().
        
        * Fixed bug in AuthenticationManager that was causing cookie authentication
        to fail.
        
        * Fixed bug in RPCHandler and test code that was causing a test to fail.
        
2009-05-05  Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-111

        * Fixed AuthenticationManager bug that prevented cookie authentication from
        working.
        
        * Fixed bug in WikiEngine.pageExists that caused pages to be reported as
        "existing" when they had been added to the JCR repository but not yet saved.
        WikiEngine.pageExists now checks to see if has actually been saved,
        whereas ContentManager does not.
        
        * Re-wrrote ContentManager.renamePage to use JCR. Sadly, Priha does
        not support Workspace.move(). If it did, maybe the renaming tests would
        all work?
        
2009-05-04  Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-110
        
        * Encountered problem with new ReferenceManager (probably related to Priha)
        that causes heap exhaustion. ReferenceManager includes a few (temporary)
        diagnostics for this. It also changes the method signatures for getRefersTo
        and getReferredBy to return lists of WikiPath. Several plugins were changed
        to accommodate this.
        
        * Added method WikiEngine.beautify(WikiPath), which works identically to
        the String version, except that those paths who are prefixed with the default
        space name (plus a colon) are rendered without the space name. WikiEngine
        also gains a method getSpaces(), which today only returns the default space.
        In the future this will be configurable.
        
        * To prevent wiki paths that have space prefixes from being interpreted as
        inter-wiki links,  JSPWikiMarkupParser prioritizes these first. This means that
        wiki space names can't be the same as those for an interwiki prefixes.
        (Which is ok: when you think about it, an outside wiki is really just a space
        managed by someone else.) This fix was needed prevent various unit tests
        from bombing.
        
2009-05-03  Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-109

        * Second commit of ReferenceManager. All unit tests now pass, although certain
        behaviors are slightly different than in the past. In particular, the WikiPaths
        passed to getReferredBy() and getRefersTo() are NOT resolved; they are assumed
        to be correct. This was an unnecessary optimization that, in practice, was not
        needed. Overall pass rate over 93%.
        
        * Relocated unit test results from to build/tests. This keeps the tests dir
        nice and clean.
        
        * Minor Javadoc tweaks.

2009-05-02  Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-108

        * Major re-write of ReferenceManager. The refactoring included moving little-used
        WikiEngine.scanWikiLinks() to ReferenceManager.extractLinks(). This method should
        never have been in WikiEngine to begin with. ReferenceManager is also completely
        "unhooked" from FilterManager/PageEvent events, and instead listens to (new)
        ContentEvents that are emitted when JCR events happen. This is much, much cleaner
        and will allow PageRenamer to be eliminated Real Soon Now (and moved to
        ContentManager, where it belongs). SearchManager is similarly unhooked from
        FilterManager and listens for ContentEvents. Among other things, this also means that
        saved pages won't be indexed twice. 10 failing unit tests remain in ReferenceManager,
        and a few bugs still need to be pounded out. I will make one more major checkin of
        ReferenceManager, soon, to fix remaining tests. Overall passrate is now nearly 93%.
        
        * Fixed subtle bug in JCRWikiPage that was causing isAttachment() to incorrectly
        report its status. Also, JCRWikiPage no longer manages its own references (now
        handled by ReferenceManager) or saves itself to the JCR (it delegates to
        ContentManager, so that ContentEvent creation can be guaranteed).
        
        * Added varargs to WikiEvent and subclasses, so that arbitrary numbers of
        arguments can be supplied with events.

2009-04-30  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-107
        
        * JSPWIKI-528: Three patches from Greg Kable to rationalize the use
        of Collections in the APIs.
        
2009-04-26  Harry Metske <metskem@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-106

        * fixed IndexPlugin, it no longer uses ReferenceManager.findCreated()
           fixed RecentChangesPluginTest and a few JUnit tests in WikiEngineTest
           JUnit Test success rate now 90.58 % (not committed changes to other plugins yet)

2009-04-25  Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-105
        
        * Many unit test fixes, including many to JSPWikiMarkupParser. About 90% of tests pass now.
        WikiPath is now truly immutable. DefaultURLConstructor omits the space name from pages if
        in the main space, and colons are no longer URLencoded. Fixed bug in ContentManager that
        was preventing page ACLs from being changed correctly if a user's name changed.
        
2009-04-23  Harry Metske <metskem@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-104

        * JSPWIKI-523 Change TableOfContentsPlugin so it generates (more) relative links
        so it properly displays when used in EditHelpPage (reported by Stefan Bohn.
        
        * Added two (dummy) methods to TestJDBCDataSource so it also compiles with JDK 6
        
2009-04-19  Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-103
        
        * Fixed bug in JCRWikiPage.isAttachment() that caused non-existent pages
        to be erroneously treated as attachments.
        
        * Fixed NPE in VariableManager.
        
        * Fixed bug in WikiEngine.getFinalPageName() that was causing
        page lookups to fail horribly. Made PageNameResolver implementations
        consistent in terms of how they treat page variants that are not found.
        
        * Fixed bug where the WikiPage references stored by WikiActionBeanContext
        and the underlying WikiContext were not synchronized. As a result,
        AbstractPageActionBean's m_page field is now private.
        
        * Massive refactoring to EditActionBean, and related spam-protection
        classes. Bug-fix to ContentManager's page-save task.
        Editing actually works again! More fixes coming later.
        
        * WikiPageTypeConverter's behavior changed. Unless the string
        passed to convert() is a special page, WikiPageTypeConverter is
        now guaranteed to return a WikiPage (which may or may not be
        persisted in the repository). SpecialPage names still cause
        the converter to return null, by design. The result of this
        change is that editing/viewing functions don't "break" if
        the page doesn't exist.
        
        * Fixed bug in InsertPageTag caused by recent introduction of
        PageNotFoundException, that was causing content not to be properly
        inserted. Fixed bugs with similar cause in LinkTag.
        
        * Fixed NPE in PermissionTag.
        
        * The @SpamProtect annotation and SpamProtect tag are now fully
        functional. Any JSP that submits to a WikiActionBean whose handler
        method is annotated with @SpamProtect receives the protection
        automatically, thanks to SpamInterceptor and collaborating
        SpamFilter. All that is needed is to add the tag
        <wiki:SpamProtect /> as a child element to the <form>
        or <s:form> elements. The same three-way check used in the
        old Edit.jsp is still done: random "trap" parameter; random
        "token" parameter; UTF-8 check parameter. To help ActionBean
        unit test classes run with protected handler events, the
        static method TestEngine.addSpamProtectParams(MockRoundtrip)
        was created.

2009-04-16  Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-102
        
        * Improved enhanced-for loops and generics throughout.
        Fixed some tag and Stripes errors that were preventing the WAR
        from running. RPC classes and search providers now propagate
        exceptions for page fetching and reindexing.

2009-04-13  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-101
        
        * At Andrew's suggestion, WikiName is now called WikiPath. Also changed
        relevant methods in WikiPage.
        
        * Small build configuration changes since not all XML was validating.
        
        * Replaced all "instanceof Attachment" calls with WikiPage.isAttachment()
        calls.
        
2009-04-12  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-100
        
        * Moved PageTimeComparator, PropertyReader and StringTransmutator
        to the util package.
        
        * Moved PageLock to org.apache.wiki.content.lock package.
        
2009-04-10  Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-99
        
        * Lots of generics improvements.
        
        * [JSPWIKI-473] Fixed bug that was causing role checks using custom
        Authorizers to fail. AuthenticationManager was not calling
        Authorizer.isInRole(WikiSession, Principal), as it should have.
        In addition to fixing the bug, we also now include a special test case
        to verify that custom Authorizers work properly. Thanks to Steve
        Dahl for reporting this issue. (This was forward-ported from 2.8.)

2009-04-06  Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-98

        * Refactored various exception-throwing code bits to use the extended
        constructors for WikiException/WikiSecurityException/ProviderException
        to provide for better logging and debugging.

        * Added support in WikiCallbackHandler for HttpRequestCallback and
        WikiEngineCallback. This means LoginModules used for JSPWiki integrated
        (custom) authentication can now access the WikiEngine and the HTTP request.
        Thanks to Lou Peters and many, many others for bringing this issue to my
        attention. Please test this function! This change has been forward-ported from
        2.8.3. 
        
        * As a result of the additional callback support for LoginModules used with
        integrated authentication, AuthenticationManager gains a new method,
        login(WikiSession,HttpServletRequest,String,String). Please use this instead
        of login(WikiSession,String,String), which is now deprecated. This change
        has been forward-ported from 2.8.3.

2009-04-05  Harry Metske <metskem@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-97
        
        * added the tests.stress.disabled property to build.properties, and minor tweak
           to build.xml. You now have the option to skip the stress tests while running
           the JUnit tests. 

2009-04-06  Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-96

        * [JSPWIKI-304] Changed all Workflow signatures so that all attribute
        values are now Serializable. This has required some minor changes
        to WikiPage get/setAttribute, such that these must also be
        Serializable too. In practice this is not a problem, because all
        attributes passed to WikiContext were always Strings anyway. The
        net effect of this change is that we can now make workflows
        persistent across engine restarts! (Coming later...)
        
        * Eliminated nearly every reference to PageManager with
        ContentManager in the code, plus or minus about two references.
        JSPs not checked yet.
        
        * Changed DefaultAclManager to extract and store ACLs parsed
        from markup, as it should be. We will need a JSP-tier GUI
        for manipulating the ACL separately. (Coming later...)
        
        * Fixed bug in HandlerInfo that was preventing evaluation
        of permissions when <null> pages were set. 

2009-04-05  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-95
        
        * Added the custom PreferencesLocalePicker to help Stripes pick
        the right locale.

2009-04-05  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-94
        
        * Got tired of the relative mess on page name resolving (as we were
        doing this in quite a few places) and delegated the task to PageNameResolver class
        (and its subclasses).  The name resolving is managed by the WikiEngine.
        
        * Moved a number of methods from WikiContextFactory to the respective
        PageNameResolver classes.
        
        * Added SpecialPageNameResolver (with some special handling) and
        EnglishPluralPageNameResolver.
        
2009-04-05  Harry Metske <metskem@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-93
        
        * added some code to Watchdog so that the stacktrace is dumped in case of 
           a timeout, we dump stacktraces of all threads if the debuglevel is
           INFO or higher
        * got rid of some javadoc errors

2009-04-04  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-92
        
        * Fixed JCRWikiPage.getChildren(). Now you can kinda deploy
        JSPWiki, but it's useless since if the main page is missing,
        everything just breaks down.
        
2009-03-31  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-91
        
        * Continued fixing ReferenceManager.  The API of ReferenceManager
        is changing slightly to use WikiNames instead of Strings to reflect
        the new multi-wiki capabilities.  This needs some fixes to tests as
        well.
        
        * WikiName.equals() enhanced to manage also String comparisons.
        
2009-03-29  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-90

        * Refactored ReferenceManager to use JCR repository.  It does
        not quite work yet, but it's a start.
        
        * Minor refactorings to remove dependencies on PageManager. 
        
        * Minor fixes to unit tests to improve pass rate.

2009-03-29  Harry Metske <metskem@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-89
        
        * JSPWIKI-487 don't show deleted and renamed pages in the breadcrumbs
           reported by Bruno Peeters
           
2009-03-28  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-88
        
        * Added WikiEngine.release() to make sure that JCR Sessions can
        be released properly at the end of requests to prevent them from
        growing uncontrollably.
        
        * Removed some obsolete methods from WikiPage.
        
        * Cleaned up AbstractFileProvider
        
2009-03-28  Harry Metske <metskem@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-87
        
        * tried to make the webtests running again:
           - removed some remaining DAV stuff from web.xml
           - correct parameters to log statements in WikiEngine, ClassUtil
           - build.xml: selenium-server-1.0-beta1.jar => selenium-server-1.0b2.jar
             and some more cleanup
           - AdminBeanManager got an extra try catch block for AccessControlException
             for some reason this exception is thrown when running webtests in jetty
           - provide a null check in StripesURLConstructor (it looks like initing the Servlet filters
             in Jetty is different than in Tomcat for example, this is bit of kludge, we should not be
             dependent on the order of filter initing)             
        
2009-03-19  Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-86

        * Fixed bug in XMLUserDatabase that was preventing UIDs from being
        saved, which generated tons of NPEs afterwards. Added unit tests
        to check for correct saving of UIDs. Tightened input filtering on
        user profile fields to prohibit more characters. [Forward-ported
        from 2.8.2-svn-14].
        
2009-03-18  Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-85
        
        * Lots of unit test and bug fixes.
        
2009-03-17  Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-84

        * PageNotFoundExceptions are now caught and thrown just
        about everywhere they should be, plus or minus whatever
        errors I made in the (very fast) process of refactoring.
        Generally speaking: all method signatures that find and
        return WikiPages *and* whose page/attachment parameters
        are Strings now throw PageNotFoundExceptions.

        * Stripes jar upgraded to r1.5.1.

        * Many changes to EditActionBean and JSPs. Initial checkin
        of SpamProtect annotation and matching JSP tag. This will
        be refined in future checkins. NO unit tests yet.
        
        * JCRWikiPage.equals() is no longer commented out. The lack
        of a functioning equals() method was hosing LOTS of unit
        tests.

2009-03-15  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-83
        
        * The WikiEngine interface now also properly propagates
        PageNotFoundException upwards so that it's actually useful
        for other components.  This meant quite a few small changes
        and tweaks around the code, not all of which might make sense.
        Please check your code for FIXME tags added by me if there's
        something special you want to do in the error situation.
        
2009-03-12  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-82
        
        * Fixed issue in ContentManager.getPage() not properly
        catching exceptions.
        
        * ContentManager now throws a PageNotFoundException when
        a page cannot be found, instead of returning null. This is
        to reduce the amount of NPEs that might otherwise appear.

2009-02-22  Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-81
        
        * Checked in Stripsified Edit.jsp. Spam detection does NOT
        work yet. Attachment uploading now supports up to 5 uploads
        courtesy of Stripes. AttachmentServlet's days are
        numbered. Merged Janne's JCR checkins into my new code; some
        inconsistencies still need to be ironed out. "Sneak preview"
        has hereby been renamed "live preview".

2009-03-06  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-80
        
        * JSPWIKI-421 Migrated AttachmentManager to use ContentManager.
        
        * Attachment is now an interface
        
        * Commented out quite a lot of test code which was directly
        instantiating Attachment - these needs to be fixed.
        
        * Removed BasicAttachmentProvider and CachingAttachmentProvider.
        
2009-03-04  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-79
        
        * Removed most PageProviders and related tests as obsolete.

2009-03-04  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-78
        
        * JSPWIKI-421: First commit. PageManager removed from use;
        AttachmentManager not yet migrated.

2009-03-03  Harry Metske <metskem@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-77
        
        * Get rid of all javadoc warnings

2009-02-27  Harry Metske <metskem@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-75
        
        * JSPWIKI-414 - denounce plugin localized, the denouncetext is now in PluginResources.properties
        
2009-02-26  Harry Metske <metskem@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-74
        
        * localized messages in all plugin
        
        * updated Dutch translation
        
        * reformatted the IfPlugin
        
        * added a few strong typing
        
        * fixed the TranslationsCheck (location of i18n files were changed)
        
2009-02-25  Harry Metske <metskem@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-73
        
        * JSPWIKI-505 - New Plugin: InterWikiLinksPlugin, thanks to Wouter Van daele
        
        * strong typing for some Collections returned by WikiEngine and a few others

2009-02-22  Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-72
        
        * Re-wrote TabbedSectionTab and TabTag so that they operate
        across included or nested JSPs.

        * Significant rework on the view-page JSP Wiki.jsp and
        related tabs. The attachments tab now has its own JSP
        (Attachments.jsp); Upload.jsp was deleted. InfoContent.jsp
        was deleted and split into 2 sub-pages; PageInfoTab.jsp
        (for wikipages) and AttachmentInfoTab (for attachments).
        These last 2 names may change. Uploading, for now, is
        disabled but will be restored in my next checkin, with
        (get this) multi-file upload.
        
        * Fixed omitted line in test properties files for rcs/vers
        that was preventing GroupManager from starting.

        * Moved contents of CommentActionBean into EditActionBean;
        moderate nips/tucks on 5 ActionBean classes.

2009-02-19  Harry Metske <metskem@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-71

        * 3.0.0-svn-70
        
        * JSPWIKI-503 - InsertPage plugin carries dashes from section
         breaks into output, thanks to Jonathan Sobel
         Also added an extra JUnit test for this.
        
2009-02-14  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-69
        
        * JSPWIKI-500: SpamFilter no longer calls Akismet on deletions.

2009-02-14  Harry Metske <metskem@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-68
        solved java.util.MissingResourceException: Could not find an error message with key: common.nopage
	               at net.sourceforge.stripes.validation.LocalizableError.getMessageTemplate(LocalizableError.java:109)
        by running Andrew's wonderfull BundleMigrator with the options :
        "copy src/WebContent/WEB-INF/classes/templates/default common.nopage \
         src/WebContent/WEB-INF/classes/CoreResources" 

2009-02-14  Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-67
        
        * Re-worked build.xml so that nearly all built artifacts, including
        for tests and webtests, are now produced in the "build" directory.
        Minor additional tweaks to prevent test classes from being included
        in JSPWiki.jar, which was messing up webapp tests. Added priha.properties
        to the WAR. Webtests are still broken, but less so than before.
        Upgraded Selenium-RC to 1.0b2; if webtests can be actually made
        to work, at least we will now be able to use them with Firefox 3.
        
        * Happy Valentine's Day! Make sure to hug the one you love today. 

2009-02-14  Harry Metske <metskem@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-66
        
        * moved contents of etc/i18n to src/WebContent/WEB-INF/classes,
           deleted etc/i18n
        * moved src/java/org/apache/wiki/plugin/denounce.properties and 
           src/java/org/apache/wiki/filters/profanity.properties
           to
           src/WebContent/WEB-INF/classes/DenouncePlugin.properties and
           src/WebContent/WEB-INF/classes/ProfanityFilter.properties
        * minor accompanying tweak to build.xml

2009-02-09  Harry Metske <metskem@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-65
        
        * JSPWIKI-496 RecentChanges plugin should filter pages.
        The IndexPlugin, RecentChangesPlugin and ReferredPagesPlugin have been
        refactored, they are now all subclasses of AbstractFilteredPlugin.
        The AbstractFilteredPlugin is the new name for the old AbstractReferralPlugin.
        As a result, you should now use Glob expressions instead of
        Regular expressions for all plugins (ReferredPages and IndexPlugin were previously
        using Regular Expressions, if you use the include/exclude parameters for those
        plugins, you should convert them to Glob expressions.)
        
        * Added a new JUnit test for RecentChangesPlugin
        
        * Changed the build.xml (removed the copy of etc/dtd, which was deleted earlier)
        
        * added etc/i18n to the classpath and changed project setting "Allow output folders
        as source folders", this makes it possible to run individual JUnit tests again.
        Also profanity.properties and denounce.properties can now be found again during 
        JUnit tests (saves a lot of stacktraces in stdout)

2009-02-06  Harry Metske <metskem@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-64
        
        * JSPWIKI-477 Renamed pages are no longer in the Lucene index
        * deletion of the ./lib directory
        * deletion of the ./etc/dtd directory (containing web-app_2_3.dtd)
        * more tweaks to build.xml
               no duplicates in the warfile anymore now 
               take the web.xml that has been filled with compiled jsp stuff
               but still more improvements necessary
               (should we have a priha.properties in WEB-INF/classes ?)

2009-02-05  Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-63

        * CommentedProperties no longer Unicode-escapes 8859-1 characters
        between 161 and 255 decimal (aka accented Latin, plus umlauts galore).
        This commit also includes the first test run of BundleMigrator, which has
        had the effect of changing the formatting of the i18n files slightly.

2009-02-05  Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-62
        
        * Additional tweaks to CommentedProperties, and fixes to 4 more failing unit tests.
       Removed some erroneous linebreaks in the Russian version of default.properties.

2009-02-04  Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-61
        
        * Fixed a few failing unit tests; tweaked build.xml so tests run again.

2009-01-30  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-60
        
        * [JSPWIKI-38] Packages renamed to the "org.apache.wiki" -hierarchy.
        Certain documentation files like UPGRADING were not touched - they need
        to be checked for 3.0 anyway.

2009-01-30  Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-59

        * Minor tweaks to Eclipse project so that tests run.

        * Improvements to CommentedProperties. Seems to mostly
        work now, although opportunities for cosmetic improvements
        remain.

2009-01-30  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-58
        
        * Rather massive restructuring of the codebase; makes JSPWiki into
        an Eclipse WTP project (tested on Ganymede; don't forget to run "ant init" first!)
        
        Modifications are:
          - src now contains all of the source code.  Subdir "java" contains all
            Java source code
          - the old src/webdocs is now src/WebContent, and also contains the former
            /lib and most of /etc/ - essentially everything that will be deployed
            inside the webapp dir.
          - tests also now live in tests/java/
          - builds are done to build/classes
       
        Build.xml has been modified for basic compile cycle + tests, but the more
        exotic things like precompiled jsps were not changed yet due to sudden
        exhaustion.
        
        * Minor changes to ContentManager API; it is no longer dependent on
        having a WikiContext.
        
2009-01-29  Harry Metske <metskem@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-57

2009-01-27  Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-56

        * Checked in BundleMigrator, which makes it easier to move, rename,
        or delete resource bundle messages across a range of property files
        with a single command. This necessitated changes to CommentedProperties,
        because it was not properly parsing multi-line messages.

2009-01-14  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-53
        
        * [JSPWIKI-421] Trying to keep up with the changes in the 
        trunk was simply getting too much, so I went ahead and committed 
        a part of the JCR code in what I hope to be non-invasive.  None of 
        the old code yet uses the ContentManager; this is just in preparation 
        for the meat.  However, it should highlight the WikiPage<->WikiContext
        creation problem.
        
2009-01-13  Harry Metske <metskem@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-52
        
        * moved a few messages to CoreResources
        
        * added missing Apache copyright templates

2009-01-13  Harry Metske <metskem@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-51

2009-01-13  Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-50

        * Localized UserDatabaseLoginModule so that it throws errors in the
        user's correct Locale.

        * Changed the stop-the-presses RuntimeExceptions thrown by
        AdminBeanManager to an (milder) error that is logged. Halting the
        WikiEngine was proving to be too aggressive in test situations.

        * Fixed b0rked jspwiki.css.

2009-01-12 Florian Holeczek <florianh@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-49

        * localization updates for German, cosmetic changes for English

2009-01-11  Harry Metske <metskem@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-48
        
        * Minor corrections to build.xml:
           - replace all hardcoded "tests" with ${tests.src}
           - renamed jar-jsp task to jar-compiled-jsps
           - also add commons-el*.jar to WEB-INF/lib in war task
           - also delete this file in war-init task an make this delete quite
           - replaced deprecated warfile parm with destfile

2009-01-10  Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-47

        * Header.jsp, PageActions*.jsp, UserBox.jsp, Footer.jsp refactored to use
        Stripes tags. i18n messages have been renamed and moved to CoreResources.
        SisterSites.jsp and rss.jsp now reference the oscache TLD buy URI, making
        the need to copy it into the webapp unnecessary.

        * Ant scripts now pre-compile JSPs when indicated by build.properties. This
        is optional.  JSPs are compiled using the Jasper 5.5 jars supplied with our test
        libs. The jasper-runtime jar is copied into WEB-INF/lib so that the JSPs will run.
        Also, the Ant 'war' task now verifies web.xml against the servlet 2.4 schema
        before compiling. Lastly, old crufty targets like Jar-signing and war-tomcat
        are gone.

        * JSPWIKI-452 - The LoggerFactory is now also multi-wiki-per-JVM capable
        Fixed a lot JUnit tests, mostly adding a m_engine.shutdown() to the tearDown()
        
        Removed the NPE checks from LoggerImpl, the NPE's were a result of stopping
        the webapp before stopping the background threads, this has been solved by
        invoking engine.shutdown() from the SessionMonitor (thanks to Andrew).
        
        Cleanup of AdminBeanManager and WikiEngine

2009-01-02  Harry Metske <metskem@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-42

        * [JSPWIKI-464] The LoginException thrown by the AuthenticationManager
        is now properly handled by the LoginActionBean (instead of showing the 
        default localized login.error message).

2008-12-31  Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-41

        * Group.jsp, DeleteGroup.jsp, EditGroup.jsp and content JSPs refactored to use
        Stripes tags. GroupTab.jsp eliminated from Preferences screen. We will re-do this,
        later. Separated Login/create profile/lost password into separate JSPs (was causing
        havoc with form submits).

        * [JSPWIKI-452]. JMX beans now register themselves using the wiki name as part of
        the MBean name, which means more than 1 webapp can co-exist.

        * [JSPWIKI-351] Stripes-related labels, field names and validation errors moved to
        CoreResources i18n files, and removed from templates/default. Message keys
        were renamed to match Stripes field names where practical.

        * [JSPWIKI-464] AuthenticationManager now handles LoginExceptions more
        gracefully and propagates them to the original caller instead of wrapping
        them in WikiSecurityExceptions.

        * Bug fix: Fixed potential NPEs in LoggerImpl.

        * Bug fix: SessionMonitor now calls WikiEngine.shutdown() when the webapp context
        is unloaded. It didn't before, which meant containers would accumulate threads
        and eventually exhaust memory.
        
        * Bug fix: TemplateManager.listLocales() was replaced with a new implementation
        that does not assume resources are loaded from JARs. This was blowing up
        Stripes unit tests when they ran in Eclipse. Now, we brute-force all possible
        locales by calling the (safer) ClassLoader.getResource() with permuted
        CoreResources_*.properties file names. Absurdly simple and foolproof.
        
        * Bug fix: to prevent potential name clashes, removed API version of WikiContext
        until we figure out what we're doing. In the interim, there should be only one.
        
        * Bug fix: exclusion of log4j.jar from Eclipse classpath was causing IDE-run
        unit tests to crash and burn. Re-added.
        
        * Happy New Year everyone!

2008-12-28  Harry Metske <metskem@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-40

        * JSPWIKI-459 PluginIndexPlugin

2008-12-22  Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-39

        * GroupActionBean finished, with unit tests. JSPs not yet. Fixed most of
        the ActionBean unit tests that were failing elsewhere in the .action
        package; down to just 4. Significant overhaul of the .action package.html Javadoc.

2008-12-21  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-38
        
        * Second step in refactoring WikiPage: WikiPage is now a part
        of the API package, and all internal methods are using that now.
        
        * This is the Winter Solstice build (only two more hours to go and
        then things start going for the better again).
        
2008-12-20 Harry Metske <metskem@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-37
        
        * JSPWIKI-291 Replace ORO regexp library with Java 5 regexps

2008-12-20  Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-36

        * Fixed some failing unit tests due to prefs refactoring.

2008-12-20  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-35
        
        * First step in refactoring WikiPage into a proper interface.  The WikiPage
        constructors are now deprecated, and most of the code now uses 
        WikiEngine.createPage().  Also, the WikiPage class is now an interface,
        though it still retains some methods which should not be in the interface.
        
        * Also created a WikiContextFactory.newViewContext(WikiPage) to get rid
        of all the null arguments.

2008-12-19  Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-34
        
        * Migrated UserPreferences.jsp and related; completely overhauled Preferences
        code so that it is much simpler, and leverages Stripes. UserPreferences.jsp and
        the collaborating UserPreferencesActionBean, in particular, are excellent
        examples of what the JSPs will look like when we are done migrating everything.
        A few bugs remain. Removed jspwiki & stripes TLDs from WEB-INF; they are
        both in their respective jars' META-INF directories now.

2008-12-19 Harry Metske <metskem@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-33
        
        * JSPWIKI-451 Russian translation, thanks to Andrew Rikhlivsky

2008-12-17  Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-32
        
        * Further refinements to Stripes-related JSPs. Refactoring of Login/Profile/View
        ActionBeans. Introduction of Stripes layout system, which makes templating
        somewhat easier (but at the moment all Stripes JSPs are  hardwired to 'default'). 
        
2008-12-11 Harry Metske <metskem@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-31
        
        * JSPWIKI-451 Fix the copyright templates on all test cases
        
2008-12-06  Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-29

        * Lots of work on user preferences/profile JSPs and ActionBeans; LostPassword.jsp
        has been assimilated into LoginActionBean. <rubs hands gleefully> Muhuhahaha!

2008-12-06  Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-29

        * Additional improvements, bug fixes to Stripes-related code.
        Wiki.jsp and PageInfo.jsp completely migrated to Stripes.

        * TemplateManager gains a new (fairly volatile) method that
        returns a ForwardResolution to content template pages.
        
        * TabTag gains a much-needed 'titleKey' property, making the
        need to embed i18n-related scriptlets in JSPs unnecessary.
        Please use this in preference to the 'title' property.

2008-12-05  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-28
        
        * Brought in the WikiName class, which should now be used
        instead of Strings to denote page names internally wherever
        possible.
        
2008-12-06  Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-27

        * Improvements to JSPs and special page handling. JSPs are still
        not quite working yet, but the webapp does run, and without too
        many errors.

2008-12-06  Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-26

        * Small tweaks to JspMigrator to look for, and fix, JSP page import directives
        for TextUtil, FileUtil and SearchResult (these have moved). Fixed JspMigrator
        Ant task ("migrate") so that it runs. Minor JSP tweaks so they compile again.

2008-12-05  Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-25

        * Fixed failing unit tests (plus or minus a few). Minor refinements
        to WikiContext.createContext().

2008-12-05  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-24
        
        * Did a mass change of StringBuffer => StringBuilder.  It's
        faster and in most cases a drop-in replacement.  Noticed that
        StringBuffer.append() was taking quite a bit of time...
        
2008-12-04 Harry Metske <metskem@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-23
        
        * implemented the unregisterAllLoggerMBeans method in the LoggerFactory
        
        * added some more robustness to LoggerFactory
        
        * made the LoggerImpl Serializable
        
        * added a note to the ReleaseNotes
        
2008-12-04  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-22
        
        * Moved WikiException, FilterException & PluginException to the 
        org.apache.jspwiki.api package.  This is a part of the overall 
        transition to have a stable API.

        * [JSPWIKI-291] Added patch from Thomas Engelschmidt to replace ORO
        regexp library with Java built-in regexps for DenouncePlugin, as well
        as DenouncePluginTest.  Thanks!

        * Moved FileUtil and TextUtil to com.ecyrd.jspwiki.util (where they
        should've been in the first place)
        
        * Moved QueryItem, SearchMatcher, SearchResult and SearchResultComparator
        to the search-package.
        
        * TranslatorReader is now gone for good.  R.I.P.

2008-12-02  Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-21

        * Split .action package: ActionBeans (only) remain in .action, while
        Stripes support classes move to .ui.stripes. Also, the JSP migrator
        code moves to package .ui.migrator. Many Javadoc tweaks also.
        
2008-12-02  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-20

        * [JSPWIKI-444] Wysiwyg editors (such as FCK) no longer duplicate
        the permalink anchors.

2008-12-02  Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-19

        * Fixed JSPs so that they compile. They still don't work, though.

2008-12-02  Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-18

        * Checked in the Stripes code (about 220 classes, tests, JSPs
        and other files). All code compiles clean, but the JSPs do NOT
        work at the moment. Unit tests run clean except for some
        stray failing Stripes-related unit tests. See the file
        doc/README - Stripes Migration for some (repeat, SOME) details
        of what it all means. I'll sort out the JSP issues later this
        week.

2008-11-06  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-17
        
        * Logging package now implements an varargs interface for
        faster and more flexible logging.  Please see Logger javadocs
        for further information.
        
2008-11-30 Harry Metske <metskem@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-16
        
        * JSPWIKI-447: InstantiationException in PluginManager
        sneaked in an example log4j override in log4j.properties
        WatchDog did not have it's Logger final.
         
2008-11-30 Florian Holeczek <florianh@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-15

        * german localization update for resources introduced in JSPWIKI-318

2008-11-30 Florian Holeczek <florianh@apache.org>

        * corrected a copy & paste error in the newly introduced log4j.properties

2008-11-29  Dirk Frederickx <dirk.frederickx@gmail.com>

        * 3.0.0-svn-14 
        
        * [JSPWIKI-288] CSS fix for the rendering of hash-links.
        
        * [JSPWIKI-318] You can now show/hide the left-menu, with a click
          of the mouse. The status of the left-menu is saved in the 
          user-pref cookie.
          
          New localization resources:
          javascript.favorites.hide=Click to hide the Favorites
          javascript.favorites.show=Chick to show the Favorites
          
          * [JSPWIKI-429] The Slimbox icon has been changed to a magnifying 
          glass. If you don't know what this is, check out the attachement
          tab. Clicking the slimbox icon provides you with a sneak preview 
          of images like png, gif, jpg.

2008-11-29 Harry Metske <metskem@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-13
        
        * JSPWIKI-376: move from log4j to slf4j
        3 new classes in the new package com.ecyrd.jspwiki.log
        - LoggerFactory
        - Logger (interface)
        - LoggerImpl
        The LoggerFactory also takes care of registering DynamicMBeans if log4j is used 
        as the underlying logging implementation.
        Log4j remains the default implementation (Stripes still needs it too) 
        Changes to 34 JSP's
        Changes to 135 Java classes
        Additions to WEB-INF/lib : slf4j-log4j12-1.5.6.jar, jul-to-slf4j-1.5.6.jar, jcl-over-slf4j-1.5.6.jar
        Removals from .classpath: commons-logging-api.jar, log4j-1.2.14.jar
        Additions to .classpath : slf4j-api-1.5.6.jar, jul-to-slf4j-1.5.6.jar
        Move log4j config statements from jspwiki.properties to log4j.properties
        Changes to build.xml (include org.apache.jspwiki in javadoc gen)
        A few other minor changes.
          
        
2008-11-21 Harry Metske <metskem@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-12
        
        * JSPWIKI-440: Plesk installation of war files.
        JSPWiki (in most cases) fails to install from an unmodified download because
        the pageDir points to a directory that cannot be created, changed a couple of default
        values in build.properties.
        
        * JSPWIKI-424 The famous trailing slash in baseURL
        Now also fixed in Installer and DefaultURLConstructor.
        
2008-11-21 Harry Metske <metskem@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-11
        
        * JSPWIKI-407: applied zh_CN patch from Hubert Chang
        
2008-11-20  Dirk Frederickx <dirk.frederickx@gmail.com>

        * 3.0.0-svn-10  -- merged from 2.8.1-svn-12
        
        * [JSPWIKI-381] fixed a bug with periodicially refreshed sneak-preview
        while in section-edit mode. When section-edit was active,
        linefeeds were inserted at every sneak-prev refresh.
        
        * [JSPWIKI-384] Filter js-scripts from input fields and cookies.
        (xss vulnerability)
        
        * Added 800x600 plain-vanilla skin
        
2008-11-18 Harry Metske <metskem@apache.org>

        * JSPWIKI-439: German localization by Florian Holeczek
 
2008-11-06  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-8
        
        * [JSPWIKI-428]: WeblogPlugin was not properly finding the page title
        due to misshapen regexp.
        
2008-11-13 Harry Metske <metskem@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-5
        
        * Stripes-1.5 resides now in lib instead of tests/lib.  Yay!
        
        * JSPWIKI-423: Plugins and filters now use annotations instead of
        jspwiki_module.xml.  Editors still do it the old way, though. 
        jspwiki_module.xml still is used to optionally locate the packages,
        through "<module package="org.mycompany"/>".  Please see PluginManager
        for documentation.
        
2008-11-10 Harry Metske <metskem@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-4
        
        * JSPWIKI-276: jsonrpc replaced by jabsorb, reported by Jorge Ferrer.
        
          Note that web.xml had changes, the package name com.metaparadigm.jsonrpc has been
          changed to org.jabsorb.
        
2008-11-09 Harry Metske <metskem@apache.org>

        * JSPWIKI-415: Favorites not displayed properly when blank in userName, reported by Trevor Harrison
          also i18n'ed the InsertPlugin as the fix for JSPWIKI-415 was there.
          Added 2 JUnit tests for InsertPage plugin
        
2008-11-08 Harry Metske <metskem@apache.org>

        * 3.0.0-svn-2

        * Added doc/Translating.txt as a guide for people who want to create
        translations.  
        
        * Added ant "i18n-check" target as an interface
        to TranslationsCheck (no need to get geeky running a Java class).
        
2008-11-06  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@apache.org>

        * Merged from 2.8: [JSPWIKI-416]: French translation and corepages from Olivier Descout

        behaviour by renaming all the links on the page.

2008-10-14  Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 2.8.0-beta-20

        * [JSPWIKI-313] ShortURLConstructor was not creating URLs for the LOGIN
        context correctly. We now check for this context specifically.

2008-10-13  Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 2.8.0-beta-19

        * [JSPWiki-342] Resolved issue by removing outdated doc files.

2008-10-01  Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 2.8.0-beta-16

        * [JSPWIKI-386] Custom LoginModules were not being configured correctly.
        Thanks to Peter Hormanns for reporting this.

2008-10-01  Dirk Frederickx <dirk.frederickx@gmail.com>

        * 2.8.0-beta-15

2008-09-30  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@apache.org>

        * Oops, Dutch corepages had overwritten the English corepages,
        so restored both English ones and created a dir for Dutch.

        * added spanish corepages
        
        * [JSPWIKI 343] Go through all built-in wikipages and make sure all of the

2008-09-24  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@apache.org>

        * 2.8.0-beta-9

        a fix.

2008-09-21  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@apache.org>

        * 2.8.0-beta-7
        
        * [JSPWIKI-379] TranslateTag now properly does a deep
        clone of the WikiContext, so that you no longer can get
        ACLs instantiated just by previewing a page.
        
2008-09-20  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@apache.org>

        * 2.8.0-beta-6

        * [JSPWIKI-369] SneakPreview was broken when no SectionEdit was turned off.

        as reported by Terry Steichen.
        
        * Few small fixes on the Accordion style.
 
2008-09-02  Juan Pablo Santos <juanpablo AT apache DOT org>

2008-08-31  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@apache.org>

        * 2.7.0-alpha-36
        
        * [JSPWIKI-366]: changenote was lost in commenting previews. Also, FCK
        was not showing the changenote field.
        
2008-08-31  Harry Metske <harry.metske@gmail.com>

        * 2.7.0-alpha-35
        
        * JSPWIKI-364:  Info tab presents null string to user (reported by Florian)
        
2008-08-31  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@apache.org>

        * 2.7.0-alpha-34
        
        * Commenting now uses the changenote field properly (and we got rid
        of the "Comment by XXX" -functionality.  Therefore, "comment.by" i18n field
        is now unused.
        
        * Renaming now uses symbols instead of English text to put in the changenote
        field.
        
2008-08-30  Harry Metske <harry.metske@gmail.com>

        * 2.7.0-alpha-33
        
        * JSPWIKI-231: update the latest de localisation patch from Florian
        and quite a few corrections to the nl localisation
        
        * Found during debugging that Lucene Indexer was using a bit 
        agressive interval of 1 second for Emptying index queue, lowered to 5 seconds
        Combined with a few textual corrections in WikiBackgroundThread 

2008-08-30  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@apache.org>

        * 2.7.0-alpha-32
        
        * JSPWIKI-27: ReferenceManager was not serializing properly when there
        was no page metadata, therefore inadvertently loading old data whenever
        the wiki was restarted. 
        
        * JSPWIKI-333: Thanks to Florian's patch, this annoying language selection
        thing should now be fixed.
        
        * Fixed Finnish localization.
        
        * The suggestion box no longer keeps suggesting wikipages if you start
        inserting a plugin or a variable.
        
        * JSPWIKI-354: Fixed issue with fallback to default template not working.
        
2008-08-30 Dirk Frederickx <dirk.frederickx@gmail.com>

        * 2.7.0-alpha-31
        
        * [JSPWIKI-346] Rename errors are now displayed inside a page-info in screen,
        above the rename section.  Some localization updates are needed.

        New resource:
            prefs.errorprefix.rename=Could not rename the page:&nbsp;

        And the CoreResources rename.* items are updated to remove the text
        "Click "back" on your browser and change the new name.".
        (done for default and .nl properties)

        * [JSPWIKI-289] The edit SuggestionMenu (plain editor only) now also allows 
        to enter a '/' to get a list of attachment links. Moreover, when you open a new link with 
        a '[', by default jspwiki displays the list of attachments of the current page.
 

2008-08-25 Dirk Frederickx <dirk.frederickx@gmail.com>

        * 2.7.0-alpha-30 

        * [JSPWIKI-329] Pagination link for All-entries fixed. Added comments to
        InfoContent.jsp to clear-out obscure pagination counting logic.
 
        * [JSPWIKI-357], [JSPWIKI-358] Wrong section counting when a page contains a TOC.

        * [JSPWIKI-359] Popup when editing page from Quick Navigation Field should only
        appear when no pagename was entered in input field.
        

2008-08-24  Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 2.7.0-alpha-29

        * Changed method signature for UserProfile.get/setUid() to use Strings rather
        than long integers. Test and XML/JDBC UserDatabase implementations changed
        also. This change was made for forward compatibility with JCR storage in  3.0. 

2008-08-24 Dirk Frederickx <dirk.frederickx@gmail.com>

        * 2.7.0-alpha-28 

        * [JSPWIKI-355] Fixing section-editing bug reported by Harry.
        
        * Saving user-preferences was broken in PreferencesTab.jsp
        

2008-08-24  Harry Metske <harry.metske@gmail.com>

        * 2.7.0-alpha-27
        
        * added my GPG key to KEYS
        
        * minor corrections/additions to UPGRADING
        
        * minor corrections/additions to the selenium readme.txt
        
        * added ${java.home}/../lib/tools.jar to path.tests, set jspwiki.login.throttling=false and some other comments in build.xml
        
        * added firefox-2 browser option (as extra comment) to build.properties
        
        * added new simple ViewPageSource selenium test
        
        * get rid of compile warning in WikiPage and WysiwygEditingRenderer and GroupManager
        
        * compile error in InputValidatorTest
        

2008-08-23 Dirk Frederickx <dirk.frederickx@gmail.com>

        * 2.7.0-alpha-26 

        * [JSPWIKI-333] Fixed side-impact in GroupManager due to new 
        InputValidator constructor.  
        

2008-08-23 Dirk Frederickx <dirk.frederickx@gmail.com>

        * 2.7.0-alpha-25  Template fixes (mainly section editing)

        * The Section-Editing user preference can now also be set via the
        default_jspwiki.properties. By default the preference is turned off.
        
                jspwiki.defaultprefs.template.sectionediting =on
        
        * Small fix to avoid section-editing [edit] link on table of contents titles.
        
        * [JSPWIKI-350] Section-Editing needs to be suppressed in a comment context.
        
        * The change-note input field is suppressed in a comment context as JSPWiki
        auto-generates the change-note for comments. Also added localization in Comment.jsp
        Added new resource to CoreResources.properties.
        
                comment.by=Comment by {0}
                
        * [JSPWIKI-329] Pagination links on the version history were still not correct
        when number of version equals a multiple of 20. Oops.
        
        * [JSPWIKI-309] Various updates of the OrderedList skin, including section editing.
      

2008-08-23 Dirk Frederickx <dirk.frederickx@gmail.com>

        * 2.7.0-alpha-24

        * [JSPWIKI-333] Language selection/deselection was not working correctly
        for some error messages. Refactored the input-validator to use correct locale.


2008-08-20  Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 2.7.0-alpha-23

        * Changed Stripes test jar to the released 1.5 version (congrats to Tim
        and the team).

2008-08-20  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@apache.org>

        * 2.7.0-alpha-22
        
        * JSPWIKI-27: Managed to duplicate this pesky bug from way old times.
        Looks like this was caused by a misread of the OSCache javadocs -
        but I am not sure if the fix causes new problems.
        
        * JSPWIKI-353: Fixed wrong i18n key in PluginManager which showed
        up if the plugin threw an exception.
        
        * JSPWIKI-352: Fixed a long-standing bug with ACLs being leaked
        from one page to another if the InsertPageTag was used.
        
        * Added a KEYS file to the top-level dir.  It would be a good idea
        if all committers added their current GPG keys to it.
        
2008-08-18  Harry Metske <harry.metske@gmail.com>

        * 2.7.0-alpha-21
        
        * [JSPWIKI-349] updated (German) corepages, credits to Florian again
        
2008-08-17  Harry Metske <harry.metske@gmail.com>

        * 2.7.0-alpha-20
        
        * [JSPWIKI-340] updated (english) corepages and README, mostly editorial changes, 
           a brief summary :
        - Java 5.0 is now a requirement for compiling (instead 1.4.2)
        - Servlet API 2.2 is mentioned, is this still enough ? (I haven't checked)
        - Removed dead link to tjworld.net/help/kb/0001_iis6-Tomcat5-JK2.html#conConnector
        - Removed links to JSPWiki 2.2 ,  2.3 and 2.4 documentation

2008-08-16  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@apache.org>

        * 2.7.0-alpha-19
        
        * JSPWIKI-315: Fixed issues with upper/lowercase filtering in 
        AttachmentManager
        
        * JSPWIKI-325: Patch from Harry to sort out plugin parameters and their 
        javadocs.
        
        * JSPWIKI-307: Pages with & in their names were not being parsed properly 
        in links.

2008-08-15  Harry Metske <harry.metske@gmail.com>

        * 2.7.0-alpha-18
        
        * [JSPWIKI-339] added German core pages, many thanks to Florian again !

2008-08-14  Harry Metske <harry.metske@gmail.com>

        * 2.7.0-alpha-17
        
        * [JSPWIKI-238] PageRenamer now correctly handles links containing blanks
          Added an additional JUnit test for this, there is stil one failing JUnit test however (attachment handling).
          PageRenamer still needs improvement.
        
2008-08-14  Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 2.7.0-alpha-16

        * Fixed invalidateSession() method in WikiSession, which was not quite
        fully invalidating sessions.

2008-08-12 Dirk Frederickx <dirk.frederickx@gmail.com>

        * 2.7.0-alpha-15

        * [JSPWIKI-334] IE6/IE7 javascript bug causes section editor to crash.
        JS is now running fine, but the Section Overview box still needs some CSS
        fixes. Ongoing.
        Note: Section Editing only works with the plain editor.
        
 
        * [JSPWIKI-337] Missing localization in WorkflowContent.jsp.

2008-08-12  Harry Metske <harry.metske@gmail.com>

        * 2.7.0-alpha-14
        
        * [JSPWIKI-231] updated de translation, thanks to Florian
        
        * fix for  [JSPWIKI-300] required some extra changes to the JUnit test for the TableOfContents Plugin

2008-08-12 Dirk Frederickx <dirk.frederickx@gmail.com>

        * 2.7.0-alpha-13

        * [JSPWIKI-329] Pagination link was still not correct for the block 21-40.
        Amazing catch from Harry and Florian - txs !
 
 
2008-08-12  Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 2.7.0-alpha-12

        * Refactored TestEngine so that MockRountrips and other heavier sessions are
        lazily initialized. Also added a property to AuthenticationManager that allows
        login throttling to be switched off (for example, during unit tests). The
        effect of these two changes cuts unit test times [on my machine] from 25 minutes
        down to about 4.5.

        * Removed reference to Stripes MockServletContext in WebContainerAuthorizer.
        It should not have been there.

2008-08-11 Dirk Frederickx <dirk.frederickx@gmail.com>

        * 2.7.0-alpha-11 - various smaller fixes in the default template

        * [JSPWIKI-302] Added the clone function to FCK.jsp. 
        Also added permission checking on the inclusion of the cloned-page.

        * [JSPWIKI-307] Redirection from UserPreferences.jsp doesn't work if "&" is included 
        in the original page name. 

        * [JSPWIKI-300] You can now also add a TableOfContents to your the LeftMenu (or Footer or ...) 
        Although a table of contents is only rendered once on a page; multiple invocations of 
        the plugin will now render an in-page link (#section-TOC) instead of a plain useless text.

        * [JSPWIKI-306] Rendering of rounded corners has been fixed. 
        However, the skin "PlainVanilla 1024x768" has been updated not to use the rounder-corners style anymore.
        This style is not considered part of core jspwiki. (will probably be removed in the future) 
        You can still use it for now (or reactivate it in the skin.js file of the skin)

        * Fixed the Left/Right orientation of Favorites block (with Left Menu) 
        for the Edit and Attachment Upload screens.

        * Made some final fixes and improvements to the SECTION editing feature. 
        It has now become a user-preference, which is by default off. (this preference is only 
        compatible with the plain editor) With section-editing on, you will get [edit] links 
        at each header which allows you to directly edit a particular section of a page. 
        In edting mode, a section overview box is shown in the left-menu allowing to switch 
        between various page section or look at the whole page.
        
        New localisation resources:
          javascript.sectionediting.label=Section Overview
          prefs.user.sectionediting=Section Editing
          prefs.user.sectionediting.text=Enable section editing via ...

        * Some minor improvements on the Accordion style to improve consistent look & feel. 
        Now also the accordion toggles show a blue +/- icon to indicate clickable regions. 
        Also added a %%leftAccordion and %%rightAccordion style, similar to book-tabs.

        * [JSPWIKI-329] the consistency and correctness of the pagination links has been improved
        in the Page Info screens. Now every block (also the first 1..20) show 20 items; 
        the link titles also match with the presented block. 
        The page size are now represented in kB, similar as attachment sizes.
        

2008-08-11 Dirk Frederickx <dirk.frederickx@gmail.com>

        * 2.7.0-alpha-10

        * [JSPWIKI-333] Language cookie is now set to default browser setting 
        when initializing the Preferences. Previously this was not required as long as the  
        user preferences were not modified by the user. Don't know why this stopped working.
        

2008-08-11  Harry Metske <harry.metske@gmail.com>

		* no version bump
        
        * JSPWIKI-319: added extra checking on Attchment Change Notes

2008-08-10  Harry Metske <harry.metske@gmail.com>

        * 2.7.0-alpha-9
        
        * JSPWIKI-320: removed all httpRequest.setCharacterEncoding() calls (except in WikiServletFilter)
        because they were called too late, reported by Clay Atkins
        
2008-08-06  Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 2.7.0-alpha-8
        
        * JSPWIKI-316: fixed SecurityConfig.jsp so that it compiles, and added
        some sensible checks for the new JAAS scheme.

        * Fixed NPE in RSSImageLinkTag, which erroneously assumes that RSSGenerator
        is always available. However, it might not be if RSS feeds are disabled.
        
        * Fixed broken Ant 'war-tomcat' target.

2008-08-03  Harry Metske <harry.metske@gmail.com>

        * 2.7.0-alpha-7

		* JSPWiki-231: added Italian localisation, thanks to Luca Gilardoni
		
		* changed the schemaLocation in web.xml, reported by Thomas van der Pol
        
2008-08-01  Harry Metske <harry.metske@gmail.com>

		* no version bump
        
        * JSPWIKI-321: remove unmappable chars from 4 sources (causing warnings during build)

        * JSPWIKI-312: small patch to build.xml, quotes around arguments of compressjs,
          reported by Florian Holeczek.

2008-07-31  Harry Metske <harry.metske@gmail.com>

		* no version bump
        
        * JSPWIKI-317: Fixed InvalidDiff in ExternalDiffProvider, thanks to Jan Spitalnik.

2008-07-31  Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 2.7.0-alpha-6

        * JSPWIKI-326: Fixed NPE in ProfanityFilter.

2008-07-16  Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 2.7.0-alpha-5
        
        * JSPWIKI-315: added extra checks to AttachmentServlet.
        
2008-07-10  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@apache.org>

        * 2.7.0-alpha-4
        
        * Fixed a number of failing unit tests, and also included
        Creole tests.

2008-07-03  Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 2.7.0-alpha-3

        * Added top-level text document UPGRADING which summarizes
        considerations for upgrading from 2.4 and 2.6. This needs more
        work, especially from the web-tier crew (Dirk et al).
        
        * Made most of the workflow package, except for the
        set/getAttributes methods in the Workflow class, serializable. In the 3.0
        timeframe, the rest of the package will be made serializable, too.
        
        * Added Ant target 'api-diff' which allows arbitrary diffing against
        previous JSPWiki.jar artifacts. It prints a nicely formatted HTML page
        describing public API differences. The report file is
        tests/reports/API-changes.html.
        
        * Upgraded Stripes jar (used in test cases) to 1.5-RC1.

2008-07-02  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@apache.org>

        * 2.7.0-alpha-2.  Yes, the last version number was an 
        anxious mistake.  It's really 2.7 alpha, not 2.8 alpha.
        
        * JSPWIKI-61: Added patch from David Au to add FCK 2.6.1
        support.  Please see the following page to enable it:
        
        http://www.jspwiki.org/wiki/HowToManuallyIntegrateFCKEditor

2008-06-30  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@apache.org>

        * 2.8.0-alpha-1

        * 2.7.0-svn-52
        
        * JSPWIKI-299: Deleting an attachment from a page which
        had been recently renamed caused an NPE.  Reported by Harry
        Metske.

2008-06-29  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@apache.org>

        * Moved all pages from wikipages under wikipages/en, and
        tweaked the build process accordingly.  Also created a basic
        Finnish translation of the CorePages.  The build process
        now creates jspwiki_corepages_en.zip and _fi.zip.

2008-06-19  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@apache.org>

        * 2.7.0-svn-51
        
        * JSPWIKI-231: Updated de i18n.
        
2008-06-25 Dirk Frederickx <dirk.frederickx@gmail.com>

        * 2.7.0-svn-50

        * [JSPWIKI-295] Sub tabs on the Admin.jsp didn't work because the
        corresponding tag ID's were containing dot's.
        
2008-06-22 Dirk Frederickx <dirk.frederickx@gmail.com>

        * 2.7.0-svn-49

        * [JSPWIKI-141] I18 properties also fixed in EditGroupContent.jsp
        
        * Included latest favicon.ico of Florian and Harry

2008-06-19  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@apache.org>

        * 2.7.0-svn-48
        
        * WikiWizard removed due to it being LGPL.  The following files
        were removed
           * webdocs/applets/wikiwizard.jar
           * webdocs/applets/WiWi-INF/
           * webdocs/scripts/jspwiki-wikiwizard.js
           * src/com/ecyrd/jspwiki/ui/admin/beans/WikiWizardAdminBean  
           
        * [JSPWIKI-231]: Updated de, zh_CN and nl.  Thanks to Florian
        Holeczek, Harry Metske and David Gao!
        
2008-06-19 Dirk Frederickx <dirk.frederickx@gmail.com>

        * No version bump

        * [JSPWIKI-295] Fixed Tabs in Admin.jsp

2008-06-19  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@apache.org>

        * 2.7.0-svn-47
        
        * Added support for the Universal Edit Button - 
        universaleditbutton.org.  About 3 mins before launch, even...

2008-06-17 Dirk Frederickx <dirk.frederickx@gmail.com>

        * 2.7.0-svn-46 

        * [JSPWIKI-293] added editor.plain.sneakpreview.title resource

        * [JSPWIKI-294] Faulty i18n in editor toolbar
        
        * [JSPWIKI-280] Scroll bar problem in IE7
        
2008-06-15  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@apache.org>

        * 2.7.0-svn-45
        
        * JSPWIKI-208: RSS images are now hidden if RSS is disabled.
        
        * Moved "info.rsspagefeed.title" key from default.properties
        to CoreResources and renamed to "rss.title".

        * Updated Finnish translation.
        
        * JSPWIKI-231: Updated Dutch and German translations.

2008-06-15 Dirk Frederickx <dirk.frederickx@gmail.com>

        * 2.7.0-svn-44 
        
        * Small fixes to plain.jsp to increase ie6 compatibilty.
        Hide the 'tab-completion' and 'smart typing pairs' from IE browsers.

        Added the i18n resource 
           editor.plain.toobar=Toolbar

        * Several IE7 fixes of the category and suggestion popup css.

        * Change the attachement icon to .gif (iso png), so it gets properly rendered on ie6.
        Added a transparent .ico file. (thanks Harry)

2008-06-14  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@apache.org>

        * 2.7.0-svn-43
        
        * JSPWIKI-145: jspwiki.applicationName is now cleaned to be a
        proper WikiName.  This is probably a good idea...
        
2008-06-14  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@apache.org>

        * 2.7.0-svn-42
        
        * JSPWIKI-185: There should be no more NPEs upon startup.  Improved
        logging as well as added a few null checks.
        
        * Fix: It was impossible to add new users due to an overzealous null check
        in XMLUserDatabase.
        
        * Improved our notification in case you have not yet installed JSPWiki.  Incidentally,
        we're using baseURL to check whether the install process is done, and because of this,
        setting baseURL becomes mandatory.
        
        * JSPWIKI-246: All new (and faster) IndexPlugin as the old one couldn't be
        converted to Apache.
        
        * Updated Finnish translation.
        
        * Added etc/ini/default_jspwiki.properties to hold all sorts of stuff that
        you normally want to enable in jspwiki.properties, but most people don't
        really want to touch.
        
        * JSPWIKI-57: Should resolve NotSerializableExceptions when container
        goes up or down.
        
        * JSPWIKI-292: Comment.jsp didn't compile.  Oops!  Thanks to Harry Metske
        for the patch.
        
2008-06-14 Dirk Frederickx <dirk.frederickx@gmail.com>

        * 2.7.0-svn-41  Many template fixes, added ajaxed edit preview, improved IE6/IE7 compat.
        
        * Fixed [JSPWIKI-275] Incoming and Outgoing link box doesn't work properly anymore. 
        
        * Several fixes of section edit: [JSPWIKI-235], [JSPWIKI-209]

        * [JSPWIKI-278] highlight search queries was handled badly when PRE sections 
        contained HTML elements.

        * [JSPWIKI-280] IE7 had the same scroll bar problem as previously with IE6.  
        Added IE7 specific CSS selector to support IE7. 

        * Fixed [JSPWIKI-259] IE rendering bug for nested collapsable boxes in IE7
        
        * [JSPWIKI-269] Improved handling of collapsible lists, even when a template 
        would not use TabbedSections. The handling of dynamic styles was refactored 
        to make them less intrusive.

        * Fixed [JSPWIKi-285]  Groups.jsp has unterminated string constant.
        Delete resource (not used anymore):
        #group.areyousure=....


        * An AJAX driven sneak-preview has been added to the plain editor. (by default off)
        The user can have immediate feedback of how the wiki-markup is rendered by means of 
        a preview box just below the editor textarea. The preview section is refreshed whenever 
        the user clicks outside the textarea.
        
        * The handling of the plain editor suggestion popup is now also working on IE. 
        Put the mouse inside a [wiki-link] to see the automatic expansion; 
        select a item of the suggestion list and click to insert the link in the editor textarea.
        This also works for attachement links. See [JSPWIKI-289] 

        Update i18n resources:
        #editor.plain.editassist=Edit Assist
        #editor.plain.editassist.title=Toggle Edit Assist buttons
        editor.plain.sneakpreview=Sneak Preview

        * The rendering of popup boxes for e.g. link-suggestion-box, %%tips, %%category. has been improved.

        * Frequently used icons merged in single 'strip' gifs to improve download speed.

        * Refactored 'jspwiki-common.js', which now only contains the core javascript. (8K compressed)
        The additional dynamic styles have been moved to 'jspwiki-commonstyles.js'. (12K compressed) 

        * Clean up of OrderList and Smart skin.   
        
        * Added a few default.nl.properties updates (eg [JSPWIKI-206])


2008-06-13  Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 2.7.0-svn-40
        
        * Removed TestHttpServletRequest, TestHttpServletResponse,
        TestHttpSession, TestFilterChain, TestFilterConfig,
        TestServletContext in favor of the much-superior Stripes
        mock objects. TestEngine was retrofitted with the Stripes
        mocks and all unit tests were also changed. In particular,
        take note of the TestEngine.newHttpRequest() factory method,
        which should be used to create test request objects.
        
        * Trimmed some unncessary web unit test classes that were
        left behind as crutches in case Selenium didn't work out. 
        
        * Upgraded Selenium-RC jars to 1.0-beta1. Selenium still
        does not work with FireFox 3, unfortunately. :(
        
2008-06-12  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@apache.org>

        * 2.7.0-svn-39
        
        * JSPWIKI-191: Favorites.jsp no longer leaks LeftMenu contents
        to unauthorized viewers in UserPreferences.jsp.  Thanks to
        Sergio Gelato.
        
        * JSPWIKI-253: VotePlugin and Vote.jsp are now gone, as they
        were pretty much useless.
        
        * JSPWIKI-206: A no-results search could also fail due to 
        missing permissions.  Updated default.properties / find.noresult
        i18n key to explain better.  Finnish and English updated.
        
2008-06-11  Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 2.7.0-svn-38
        
        * Web unit tests refactored (yet again) to use an embedded
        Jetty server. This replaces the need to use a separate Tomcat
        server, and *should* always work without any configuration of
        any kind. Please tests this via the Ant 'webtests' target!
        Note that this checkin introduces the TestContainer class, which
        with a little modification (later, please!) could easily be
        used as a stand-alone server. Refactorings are welcome; in
        the meantime, TestContainer should be considered volatile.
        Note also that the Rename Profile web unit tests for the
        container scenarios currently fails; all others run successfully.
        
        * Minor tightening of Map API for Serializer methods; the
        keys are now Strings rather than Serializable. This is a
        dev branch, remember!
        
        * Added Stripes jar in preparation for replacement of
        TestRequest/Response mock objects.

2008-06-09  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@apache.org>

        * 2.7.0-svn-37
        
        * JSPWIKI-290: ReferenceManager was not updating the page
        references correctly after a rename.  Fix by Harry Metske.
        
        * Fixed also a number of miscallaneous FindBugs issues.

2008-06-09  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@apache.org>

        * 2.7.0-svn-36
        
        * JSPWIKI-14: checkPermissions code in MetaWeblogHandler is now
        functional.
        
        * JSPWIKI-228: Added patch from Alexander Chow to fix a problem
        where multiple headings with the same text were producing illegal
        XML through duplicated ID attributes.
        
        * JSPWIKI-274: Was fixed already in svn-31.
        
        * JSPWIKI-286: Fixed a couple of typos in Finnish localization.
        
        * JSPWIKI-285: Group.jsp had a wrong quote char in English,
        Dutch and German translations.

2008-06-08  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@apache.org>

        * 2.7.0-svn-35
        
        * JSPWIKI-283: Ooops.  Copy != Cut.
        
2008-06-07  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@apache.org>

        * 2.7.0-svn-34
        
        * JSPWIKI-265: All referrer changes (according to unit tests anyway)
        work now.
        
        * JSPWIKI-30 should now also be resolved.
        
        * JSPWIKI-27: I have a suspicion that implementing WikiPage.equals()
        has caused some interesting issues with attributes being leaked from
        old versions.  Removed equals() for now.
        
        * Some JSPWikiMarkupParser speed optimizations by changing all
        StringBuffers to StringBuilders.

2008-06-07 Dirk Frederickx <dirk.frederickx@gmail.com>

        * 2.7.0-svn-33
        
        * Added favicon.ico, and updated the jspwiki.properties to support *.ico

2008-06-01  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@apache.org>

        * 2.7.0-svn-32

        * Password hashes were generated in platform native encoding
        instead of UTF-8.  Oops.
        
        * In general, there have been massive upgrades of Javadocs.

2008-05-31  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@apache.org>

        * 2.7.0-svn-31
        
        * Oops, wrong regexp: AttachmentServlet now *really* cleans up
        the filename.
        
        * Added some sanity checks to hopefully address an issue that
        Jim Willeke was having with the parser crashing at odd places. 

2008-05-29  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@apache.org>

        * 2.7.0-svn-30
        
        * AttachmentServlet now cleans the uploaded file name, since some
        browsers send the full path as well.
        
2008-05-22  Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 2.7.0-svn-29
        
        * Checked in three new features for UserProfile and the UserDatabase
        classes. First, profiles can now store arbitrary Serializable objects
        via a new method in UserProfile, getAttributes, that returns a
        Map<Serializable,Serializable> that can be directly manipulated.
        Arbitrary attributes such as user preferences can be added to the
        profile and be guaranteed to be persisted on save. Second, the
        UserProfile now has two methods setLockExpiry(Date)/getLockExpiry
        that allow callers to disable user profiles. These are NOT enforced
        in AuthenticationManager yet. Third, user profile now have a 'uid'
        field that stores a long value for uniquely identifying users.
        Existing profiles without UIDs are automatically upgraded when
        they are loaded by a findBy___() method. The default XML/JDBC
        UserDatabase implementations have been enhanced to support all
        of these new features. If you have custom UserDatabase
        implementations, you should take a look at the new code.
        
        * Miscellaneous and varied Java 5 enhancements (such as for-loops).

2008-05-22 Juan Pablo Santos <juanpablo AT apache DOT org>

        * 2.7.0-svn-28
        
        * [JSPWIKI-25].  Creating empty pages should not be possible (default
        behaviour). Can be changed by setting jspwiki.allowCreationOfEmptyPages
        to true in jspwiki.properties.
        
        * <i18n-create-template> target in build.xml was creating a wrong i18n 
        directory structure.

2008-05-11  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@apache.org>

        * 2.7.0-svn-27
        
        * [JSPWIKI-44].  AuthenticationManager now remembers the last logins
        and slows down repeated access attempts, to a maximum of 20 seconds.

2008-05-11  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@apache.org>

        * 2.7.0-svn-26

        * [JSPWIKI-236]: Fixed localization for the different login/edit
        help pages missing.    
        
        * [JSPWIKI-170]: Fixed a few places where the author was appearing
        as "unknown".
        
        Added new i18n key in CoreResources, updated English and Finnish:
        
           * common.unknownauthor
           
        * [JSPWIKI-151]: If sending a password succeeds, it is no longer reported
        as an error.
        
2008-05-18  Dirk Frederickx <dirk.frederickx@gmail.com>

        * 2.7.0-svn-25
        
        * Temporary remove hideable favorites menu as it is incompatible with FCK.
        Final fix to commit later.  The FCK-Editor is now again fully working.
        (Reported by Florian Holeczek)  JSPWIKI-209
        
        * Fixing various IE7 incompatibilities (jspwiki.css)
        Reported by Gavin Goldsmith. 
        

2008-05-14  Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 2.7.0-svn-24

        * [JSPWIKI-20] Passwords are now salted and hashed per RFC 2307.
        Every password is salted with a 8-byte random salt.

        * The sort-of-secret "share container user accounts with
        JDBCUserDatabase" option has been permanently removed, and
        will not be replaced. This was previously added to make it easier
        for users to add themselves to JDBC-based container realms.
        However, the switch to salted passwords precludes the continued
        use of this option. So it's gone and won't come back.

        * Added a new class CryptoUtil that allows admins to generate
        SSHA password hashes (and verify an existing password given
        a supplied hash) at the command line. See the Javadoc
        for com.ecyrd.jspwiki.util.CryptoUtil for details.

2008-05-11  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@apache.org>

        * 2.7.0-svn-23
        
        * [JSPWIKI-265] Referrers are now changed, though the
        functionality is still a bit broken in places.
        
2008-05-11  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@apache.org>

        * 2.7.0-svn-22
        
        * [JSPWIKI-260] ReferringPagesPlugin now creates the "more"
        link URL properly.  This also impacts the localization of
        the "referringpagesplugin.more" in PluginResources.
        
        * Moved plugin resources from etc/i18n/com/ecyrd/jspwiki/plugin 
        to etc/i18n/plugin.  Can't remember who suggested this.  Also
        cleaned build.xml to make sure the plugin files are created
        properly.  Can't remember who suggested this, neither can
        I seem to find the JIRA issue...
        
        * [JSPWIKI-224] TranslatorReader now is just a proxy to the
        JSPWikiMarkupParser.  It will be finally gone in 3.0.
        
        * [JSPWIKI-183] PageRenamer no longer chokes if attachments
        are turned off.  Reported by Luca Gilardoni.
        
        * [JSPWIKI-234] Added ISO8601 time formats to default patterns.
        
2008-05-10  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@apache.org>

        * 2.7.0-svn-21
        
        * Logincookies are now written with UTF-8 instead of platform
        default encoding.  This should fix issues with users with non-ASCII
        chars sometimes having the wrong UID when their session expires.

2008-05-09  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@apache.org>

        * 2.7.0-svn-20
        
        * [JSPWIKI-251]: Removed the old com.ecyrd.jspwiki.PageRenamer
        and replaced it with com.ecyrd.jspwiki.content.PageRenamer, which
        is fully Apache-licensed.
        
        Unfortunately, the new PageRenamer does not support changing
        referring pages yet, error messages are not localized properly,
        etc.  So this is a considerable functionality downgrade until
        we can get a better version made.  Patches gladly accepted!

2008-05-06  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@apache.org>

        * 2.7.0-svn-19
        
        * [JSPWIKI-50] Improved performance of RecentChangesPlugin by 
        adding better caching to the CachingAttachmentProvider.  Thanks
        to Harry Metske!

2008-05-05  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@apache.org>

        * 2.7.0-svn-18

        * [JSPWIKI-239] jspwiki.cookieAuthorization.expiry is now called
        jspwiki.cookieAuthentication.expiry, because that is correct.  Thanks
        to Florian!

        * 2.7.0-svn-17
        
        * Removed JUG UUID generation libraries to favour the Java
        built-in ones.
        
2008-04-20  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@apache.org>

        * 2.7.0-svn-16
        
        * Moved the rest of the PluginResources class into etc/i18n, as
        their old place was confusing people.
        
        * [JSPWIKI-243], [JSPWIKI-244], [JSPWIKI-242], [JSPWIKI-241] Fixed
        a number of issues with plugins not using the proper date/time from
        the locale/preferences.
        
        * [JSPWIKI-245] Removed PluginResources / common.dateformat, and
        created three new time/date format resources in CoreResources:
           * common.dateformat
           * common.timeformat
           * common.datetimeformat

        * 2.7.0-svn-15
        
        * [JSPWIKI-5] FileSystemProvider now properly mangles names of pages which
        start with a dot.  This is done in a fully backwards compatible manner,
        so no changes to the repo is needed.
        
        * [JSPWIKI-100] Added two new parameters to ReferringPagesPlugin,
        UnusedPagesPlugin, ReferredPagesPlugin, and UndefinedPagesPlugin:
        show and showLastModified.  Thanks to Harry Metske for the patch!

        * 2.7.0-svn-14
        
        * [JSPWIKI-165] Patch from Tomasz Szymko to help in nested bullet lists.
        
        * Also updated several files to the Apache license.

        * 2.7.0-svn-13
        
        * [JSPWIKI-178] Patch from Jorge Ferrer to keep the order of search (WEB-INF
        then classpath then file system) of filters.xml.
        
        * [JSPWIKI-231] Updated es translation and applied patches from Florian 
        Holeczek (de translation) and Harry Metske (nl translation).
        
        * ProfanityFilter minor improvement: profanities are read from a file 
        instead of being hard-coded strings.

2008-04-13  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@apache.org>

        * 2.7.0-svn-12
        
        * [JSPWIKI-10] Patch from Harry Metske to make sure 
        VersioningFileProvider and AbstractFileProvider check for
        proper permissions.

2008-04-12  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@apache.org>

        * 2.7.0-svn-11
        
        * Improved restart time at the expense of more disk being
        used and the first startup taking a bit longer.
        
        * Acl implementation, permissions and our Principals now
        implement Serializable.  It could be used to improve startup
        time even further, but it will be useful for the future.

2008-04-05  Dirk Frederickx <dirk.frederickx@gmail.com>

        * 2.7.0-svn-4
        
        * Refactored JS to support the Edit Suggestion box, so it's now fully based on mootools.
        The entries in the suggestion box are now clickable: the page or attachment link will be
        inserted in the textarea. Also the handling of the | bar inside a link has been improved.

        * [JSPWiki-200] The length of the entries in the Edit Suggestion are truncated to avoid
        overlap with the main body of the edit area.

        * The build script has been updated to use the YUI compressor. It now compresses both 
        javascript and css files. (this replaces the Dojo compressor, which only handled js)
 
        * In the UserPreferences you can now select the preferred language. 
        The default language is based on the user's browsers setting, but a dropdown allows you to 
        select any of the installed languages.
        The PreferencesTab.jsp has been refactored, with help of Juan Pablo Santos Rodriguez.
        All java handling has been moved to TemplateManager.java and Preferences.java.
        
        New i18n resources (already added for .en and .nl) 
            prefs.user.language=Select Language
            prefs.user.timezone.server=[SERVER]
            prefs.user.language.default=[DEFAULT]

        * Added an are-you-sure prompt to the UserPreferences.jsp when leaving the page without saving.

            javascript.prefs.areyousure=Without clicking the Save User Preferences button, \
                 your changes will be lost. Are you sure you want to exit this page?

        * [JSPWIKI-226] "View Page Source" now also displays 'non-latest' page versions

        * Suppress the 'ViewPageSource' in the more menu when the page doesn't exist yet.

        Added missing i18n resource
            actions.rawpage.title=View Page Source

        * Improved the implementation of the 'more menu' to resolve the intermediate screen glitch. 
        When javascript is off, the more menu will now be displayed at the top of the Favorites block,
        when javascript is on, the more menu becomes a mouse-hovered drop-down.
        

        * In the user-preferences, you can position the favorites menu Left or Right.
        Now it is also possible to make the Favorites menu hidden, allowing the body of the page
        to fith the full with of the screen. This should benefit narrow (mobile) devices.
        The favorites menu is still reachable via a mouse-hovered menu.

        Added i18n resources:
             javascript.favs.show="Click to show Favorites"
             javascript.favs.hide="Click to hide Favorites"

        * The javascript initialization parameters have been changed to XHTML META tabs 
        to reduce xss vulnerability. (commonheader.jsp)
        Now username's with embedded single quotes do not crash the js anymore.

        * [JSPWIKI-209] Section editing has been added. (feature original in the BrushedTemplate)
        When a page is editable, each section header gets an additional [edit] label.
        In edit mode, a section drop-down has been added which allows to filter the text-area to the
        section of interest.

        Added i18n resources:
              javascript.quick.edit=[Edit]
              javascript.quick.edit.title=Edit section: {0}
              edit.sections=Sections

        * [JSPWIKI-193] Flawed login.loginhelpmissing text in en, de, nl locales. 
        Fixed for .en, .nl, .de was already fixed. 


2008-03-30  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@apache.org>

        * 2.7.0-svn-3
        
        * [JSPWIKI-225] Added patch from Harry Metske to fix a problem
        with password not being shown during installation.
        
        * [JSPWIKI-227] Added patch from Harry Metske to fix problem
        with installation translation in English and Dutch.
        
        * [JSPWIKI-203] Counter plugin now supports both hiding results
        as well as "start" and "increment" options.  Patch mostly from
        Harry Metske.
        
2008-03-31  Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 2.7.0-svn-2

        * Changed Ant build script to use 1.5 sources and targets.

        * Re-factored the authentication subsystem to remove the need
        for JAAS configuration files. WEB-INF/jspwiki.jaas goes away,
        as does the need for PolicyLoader. Also, responsibilities for web
        authentication move to WikiServletFilter. Authentication is now
        configured via jspwiki.properties -- see that file for details.
        WikiSession API change: getLoginContext() vanishes.

        * The auth.login.*LoginModule classes are mildly re-factored to
        remove any need to have knowledge of how to (or why) to inject
        JSPWiki Role principals. Responsibility for injecting Roles moves
        to WikiSession. JSPWiki can use ANY LoginModule for custom
        authentication now.

        * To support the auth refactoring, we introduce several *temporary*
        new servlet mock objects for unit testing: TestFilterChain, TestFilterConfig,
        TestHttpServletResponse, and TestServletContext. These are "temporary" 
        because they will be replaced by Stripes mock objects later in the
        2.7 release cycle.

2008-03-30  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@apache.org>

        * 2.7.0-svn-1

        * Fixed failing Selenium web unit tests so that they run correctly,
        with two exceptions. See tests/etc/selenium/readme.txt; this file
        includes a few notes on how to write Selenium tests so that they
        will run automatically via the Ant "webtests" target.

        * Tweaks to Javadoc so that they build cleanly. No functionality changes.

2008-03-08  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@apache.org>

        * 2.6.2-svn-4
        
        * [JSPWIKI-154].  Removed double entries from CoreResources and made
        sure everyone uses it.
        
        * [JSPWIKI-201].  Added simplified Chinese from David Gao.  Thanks!
        
        * [JSPWIKI-161].  Added TranslationCheck from Florian Holeczek.  Removed

2008-3-01  Dirk Frederickx <dirk.frederickx@gmail.com>

        * Minor stylesheet updates (no version bump)
        
        * Leading digits for ordered lists were cut off because padding value was too small.
        (detected by Florian Holeczek)
 
        * Long headings which break into two or more lines had insufficient line-height, so
        they were "squeezed into one another"  (detected by Florian Holeczek)
               

2008-2-24  Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 2.6.2-svn-3
        
        * Reverted the JSP changes from my last commit so that existing 2.6 deployments
        don't need to reconfigure web.xml. That commit removed the fmt:setBundle tag
        because of the addition of a servlet config parameter in web.xml. The web.xml
        modifications remain, however, so that any new JSPs won't need to use setBundle.
        For 2.8, we will remove the setBundle tags entirely.

2008-2-24  Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 2.6.2-svn-2

        * [JSPWIKI-195]: Superfluous WEB-INF/i18n directory created during war build.
        Also, several unneeded JARs were also being included.

        * Eliminated the need to hard-code <fmr:setBundle> tags in JSPs by setting
        the web.xml <comtext-param> javax.servlet.jsp.jstl.fmt.localizationContext
        so that it points to templates.default. Removed the setBundle tags from
        all JSPs.

        * 2.6.2-svn-1

        to Florian Holeczek
        
        * [JSPWIKI-173]: Oops, we had a detection routine for illegal XML chars,
        but unfortunately it was outputting the same illegal chars to the as an
        error...

2007-12-10  Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 2.6.1-rc-2

        * Changed default tests/etc/groupdatabase.xml and tests/etc/userdatabase.xml
        so that they use the platform-independent date formats for creation/modification
        datestamps. Also, fixed a bug in XMLUserDatabase that caused "old" date formats
        to not be converted on startup. Thanks to Harry Metske for reporting this issue.

        * Tiny tweak to Eclipse classpath so that class files are put in build/ and tests/build. 

2008-01-27  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * 2.6.1-rc-1
        
        * [JSPWIKI-166]: Added a default mail sender to ward off an evil NPE.  
        I have a suspicion that things still don't work as documented, but 
        at least there is no NPE anymore.

        * [JSPWiki-123] : The set of user-preference timeformats moved to the 
        jspwiki.properties, such that the administrator can easily choose timeformats,
        if needed even localize them.

        * [JSPWiki-137] Toggle details button is now working and i18n'ized in Workflow page
        Added a new item to default.properties:

            workflow.creatUserProfile=New user profile <strong>{2}</strong>

        * [JSPWiki-144] : LoginHelp links to LoginPageHelp in l10n variable

        * 2.6.1-cvs-8

        Reported by Tomasz Szymko.
        
        * [JSPWIKI-132]: FindContent had an untranslated string.  Reported by
        Tomasz Szymko.
        
        * [JSPWIKI-131]: Changed "authenticated" to "authorized" in all built-in
        localizations.  Thanks to Fabian Haupt for en, de and es.
        
        * [JSPWIKI-114]: Fixed issue with VariableManager not checking the parent
        page for variables in case the InsertPage plugin was used.  Thanks to
        Stephen Solka!
        
        * [JSPWIKI-118]: Fixed issue with FCK editor not saving all metadata.  Thanks
        to David Au for the fix!

2008-01-12 Dirk Frederickx (dirk.frederickx@gmail.com)

        * 2.6.1-cvs-7
        
        * [JSPWIKI-128] fixed various issues in the  printing style sheet.
        Validation of IE is pending.

        
2008-01-07  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * 2.6.1-cvs-6
        
        * [JSPWIKI-95]: Links to anchors with blanks work now.  This introduces
        a tiny, very tiny compatibility issue with links to headings changing
        case in some cases.  Reported by Jügen Weber.
        
        * [JSPWIKI-125]: FilterManager now checks for version compatibility 
        of PageFilters by looking into the ini/jspwiki_module.xml.  This was a 
        surprisingly big change.  I would very much like to move to annotations
        in 3.0... Reported by Florian Holeczek.

        * [JSPWIKI-124]: Turns out that using de_DE as the language name
        is not a good idea, as it really works only when you define Deutsch (Deutschland)
        as your language - all other German-speaking folks would see Englisch...
        Reported by Goran Karlic.

        * added stress/MassiveRepositoryTest.

2008-01-06  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * Fixed a number of Eclipse warnings.  No version bump, no
        functionality change.

2008-01-05 Dirk Frederickx (dirk.frederickx@gmail.com)

        * No version bump - small fix of exception in Footer.jsp

2008-01-05  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * 2.6.1-cvs-5

        * [JSPWIKI-108]: Fixed EditPageHelp.txt which had an extra pipe char.

        * [JSPWIKI-106]: Password recovery emails are now sent with UTF-8 encoding.

        * [JSPWIKI-113]: Patch from Harry Metske to make sure the JNDI factory is
        only checked once when sending email.

        * [JSPWIKI-119]: URI detector now detects properly ~ and % characters.

2008-01-03 Dirk Frederickx (dirk.frederickx@gmail.com)

        * 2.6.1-cvs-4

        * Improving robustness of Wiki.getPageName(url) which was dying on unexpected url formats.


2008-01-02  Dirk Frederickx (dirk.frederickx@gmail.com)

        * 2.6.1-cvs-3

        * [JSPWIKI-49] Fixed handling of the Editor choice as part of the user preferences.
        When restarting the browser, also the preferred editor setting is recovered.
        Still 2 properties exist to set the default Editor choice (both are kept for bw compat)
        You can choose either one.
          jspwiki.editor=plain
          jspwiki.defaultprefs.template.editor =plain    (=> preferred)

        * All WEBTESTs are now converted to Selenium. They run manually -- still need to verify
        the automatic run via ant.

        * The MORE dropdown is now also available during Login, UserPreferences and Find screens.
        This makes all common links (stored in MoreMenu) more easily accessible.

        * Minor JS refactorings on handling color for GraphBars and ZebraTables.

        * Minor JS refactorings to better support Category styles for IE.

        * Both JSPWiki logo's (shaded and not-shaded image) have been merged in a single .png
        to resolve image flicker at mouse-hover. (especially on ie)


2007-12-10  Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 2.6.1-cvs-2

        * [JSPWIKI-116] Under certain circumstances, calls to
        UserManager.getUserDatabase() are made before the user database is
        actually initialized, resulting in NPEs. To resolve, we simply replaced
        internal references to m_userDatabase with getUserDatabase(),
        which lazily initializes the database if it has not already happened.

2007-12-25  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * 2.6.1-cvs-1

        * Added SpamFilter.isValidUserProfile() and corresponding checks
        to allow also user registrations to be spam-checked.

2007-12-22  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * 2.6.0!  Woot!

        * Removed JSPWikiToCreoleTranslator (the class was empty and unused)
        in an effort to clean the code base a bit for release.

        * Added some warnings to CreoleFilter & CreoleToJSPWikiTranslator
        to make sure people understand they are experimental features.  Also
        removed WikiCreole from "new features" list.

        * Fixed a number of failing unit tests for Creole by removing a lot of
        line separator management code.  As far as I can tell, it was all
        unnecessary and by accident didn't fail only on Windows.

        * Improved javadocs, removing a number of Checkstyle errors.

2007-12-10  Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 2.6.0 RC5

        * Checked a new version of web.xml that I inadvertently missed
        in RC3. This resolves [JSPWIKI-92], for real this time. Sorry!

        * Resolved [JSPWIKI-33] by removing all external class dependencies
        in WikiBackgroundThread (other than JSPWiki.jar classes). Also
        changed the default webtests-teardown task in Ant so that web unit
        tests are taken down unless the 'webtests.keepup' property is set.

        * Replaced jug-lgpl with the Apache-licensed version [JSPWIKI-41].

        * The Ant war/test war tasks were not always properly excluding
        test-related jars, such as Selenium. This was causing webapps to
        fail to load in some cases. These jars have now been moved to tests/lib.

        * Adjusted the README file in lib to reflect reality.

2007-12-10  Christoph Sauer <sauer@hs-heilbronn.de>

        * 2.6.1 RC4

        * (I am really not sure if I am numbering right here, since
           I fixed a bug, should the revision number not be incremented
           as well, according to [JSPWIKI:VersioningProposal]?)

        * Fixed Bug in CreoleFilter: When you used the signature
          markup from creole (--~~~~), plugin syntax did not get properly
          translated back into creole markup, so even if you
          typed in <<Plugin>>, it was later displayed in the source
          as [{Plugin}]

        * Added some missing linebreaks in translation

2007-12-10  Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 2.6.1 RC3

        * Fixed Ant script compatibility issue reported in [JSPWIKI-109].
        JSPWiki's 'war-tomcat'  and 'webtests' tasks now work correctly
        when running under Tomcat 5.5 *and* 6.0.

        * Fixed a compatibility bug that was preventing JSPWiki from
        starting in an older version of Resin [ JSPWIKI-92]. This issue surfaced
        three bugs: web.xml's <description> and <display-name> elements
        were in the wrong order; an unneeded SAX parser feature was being
        set in WebContainerAuthorizer; and (most egregiously) TabTag
        overrode a superclass method, setId(), when it should not have.
        TabTag's implementation has been "pulled up" to WikiTagBase, and it
        now delegates properly to the superclass. In addition, as a bonus,
        all "id" attributes for custom JSPWiki tags are now immunized from
        cross-site scripting injection.

2007-12-05  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * 2.6.0 RC2

        * Changed versioning scheme

2007-12-16  Christoph Sauer <sauer@hs-heilbronn.de>

        * 2.6.2 RC1

        * [JSPWIKI-101]: Fixed, TOC plugin did not call filter

        * Improved MissingTranslations utility, now outputs sorted list
          of diff properties.

        * Added missing german translations

2007-12-10  Andrew Jaquith <ajaquith AT apache DOT org>

        * 2.6.1 RC1

        * Ripped-and-replaced web unit tests and replaced with Selenium.
        Selenium test directory structure replaced with a patched
        selenium-server-0.9.2.jar. Web tests are yet not at parity
        with old (failing) JWebUnit tests, they are pretty good for
        a start. Many thanks to Dirk to figuring out the minor patches
        we needed to get Selenium to work nicely with Mootools.

        * Removed all traces of JMeter, HttpUnit and JWebUnit
        (as much as I could find, anyway).

        * Re-based Selenium tests to tests/etc/selenium/tests.

        * If you want to try developing your own web tests, check out
        Selenium IDE, a FireFox plugin that records user actions
        and generates tests scripts.

2007-12-05  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * 2.6.0 RC1

        * [JSPWIKI-55]: Added patch from David Au to fix pages
        with spaces.

        * [JSPWIKI-62]: Added patch from David Au to fix ShortURLConstructor
        and plain.jsp.
