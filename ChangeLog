       * 2.10.4-git-04

       * JSPWIKI-1039/JSPWIKI-1067: ACLs are not taken into account when cache
         is disabled / View-only ACLs are not enforced

2018-03-29  Juan Pablo Santos (juanpablo AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.10.4-git-03

       * 2.10.4-git-02

       * Further fix on JSPWIKI-1064 - Link to non-existing page doesn't change if
         linked page is created, not all page caches were properly flushed.

2018-03-04  Juan Pablo Santos (juanpablo AT apache DOT org)

       * Another fix on JSPWIKI-1064 - Link to non-existing page doesn't change if
         linked page is created, as the page render cache must also take into account
         if the plugins should be rendered or not.

       * JSPWiki portable: Update bundled Apache Tomcat to latest version on 7.x branch
         and launch4j to 3.11.

       * 2.10.3-git-46

       * JSPWIKI-802 - Markdown support
         * urls are not set on attribute provider derived classes, as this has some
           unwanted side effects. Introduced JSPWikiLink, a wrapper around Flexmark's
           links which retain the original wiki link.
         * updated Flexmark to 0.28.24.

       * 2.10.3-git-43

       * Fixed JSPWIKI-843 - generate test-jar for jspwiki-war (wasn't being generated)

       * Extract WikiLink parsing operations from JSPWikiMarkupParser, LinkParser,
         VariableManager to their own class, LinkParsingOperations

       * Move (private) JSPWikiMarkupParser#getLocalBooleanProperty to
        (public) WikiContext#getBooleanWikiProperty

2017-11-16  Juan Pablo Santos (juanpablo AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.10.3-git-42

       * small refactor to move some private constants to public at MarkupParser and
         WikiRenderer, so they can be reused throughout the code and custom extensions.

2017-08-22  Juan Pablo Santos (juanpablo AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.10.3-git-41

       * WysiwygEditingRenderer isn't hardcoded in JSPs anymore, and can be substituted
         through jspwiki.renderingManager.renderer.wysiwyg property on jspwiki.properties.
         This allows to develop custom renderers which do not expect the same information
         as the existing ones.

       * Fixed DefaultFilterManager#modules not returning Collection< WikiModuleInfo >,
         as it was supposed to. This method wasn't used anywhere, until now, where it
         is used through FilterBean, a new JSPWiki AdminBean exposing existing filters
         information.

       * FilterBean runs parallel to PluginBean, which allowed some more minor internal
         refactorings and code polishing.

       * Moved some constants from JSPWikiMarkupParser to MarkupParser.

2017-07-16  Juan Pablo Santos (juanpablo AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.10.3-git-40

       * Some small changes around JSPWikiMarkupParser, needed to develop
         custom markup parsers, which do not rely on the former class or
         WikiDocument.

       * Some other minor internal refactorings and code polishing

2017-05-14  Harry Metske (metskem@apache.org)

       * Fixing some minor issues with the Image plugin ALIGN parameter

       * %%magnify: add a magnifying glass to to reveal details of a cropped images.
         Hover the mouse above the image to see the effect.

       * Redesigned Header
         The header (including the menu bar) now shifts up when you scroll down,
         and reappears when scrolling back-up.  So you can quickly have access
         to all the menu's and the quick search function.  Clicking the pagename
         in the header get's you immediately back to the top of the page.
         The menu bar has now become part of the (coloured) header section.

       * Editor:
         Improved the speed of the editor quick preview when editing large pages.
         Updates to various editor auto-suggest dialogs.

         escape HTML entities in captions.

       * several CSS stylesheet additions
         - image styles : effects, captions, frames, animation
         - background styles : color, background images

       * JSPWIKI-1050 The find and replace do not seem to work  (Haddock editor)

         Pressing Ctrl-F has been removed as short-cut key for the wiki editor.
         Ctrl-F brings you always to the standard browser dialog. (as expected)
         To open JSPWiki's Find&Replace dialog, click the toolbar button.

         The Find&Replace dialog now also indicates if text was selected before.
         If that case, the Find&Replace will run only on the selected text.

2015-08-16  Dirk Frederickx (brushed AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.10.2-svn-32  Haddock Template updates & WYSIWYG editing

       Haddock Template:

       * [JSPWIKI-902] Printing improvements for the HADDOCK template,
         hiding sidebar, userbox, wrapping long page-names, and a few other tweaks.

       * The Page Footer now sticks to the bottom of the screen, even for short pages

       * Fixed an issue with the persistence of the status of collapsible lists

       * Added fixes for IE compatibility for the bootstrap css framework.

       * [JSPWIKI-892] Haddock editor should put the cursor at the top of the textarea,
         also when opening the editor with a certain section

       * Improved the header layout (suggestion of Harry) moving the quick search field
         into the searchbox dropdown.

       * [JSPWIKI-908] The basic editor toolbar icons (bold, italic, link, etc..)
         are back in the plain editor of HADDOCK.


       WYSIWYG further enhancements

       * (experimental) Included a plain vanilla wysiwyg editor to JSPWiki.
         This editor is based on mooEditable, MIT licensed.
         This editor is unfortunately not compatible with the default template.

         You can still add your own wysiwyg editor to JSPWiki -- hooks are provided
         for TinyMCE and CKeditor.

       * Added ajax-based live-preview for wysiwyg editors to the Haddock Template.
         When editing in wysiwyg mode, you now get immediately a preview of the wiki markup.
         (similar to the live-preview mode of the plain editor)

       * The wysiwyg editors are now resizable, just like the plain editor..


2015-08-04  Dirk Frederickx (brushed AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.10.2-svn-31  Haddock Template small fixes

       * Loading error on hadock.js and haddock-edit.js fixed. (async attribute)

       * IEx tweaks
         - remove unnecessary scrollbars
         - attempt to resolve the broken icon-fonts on IE11

       * %%add-css style fix to handle special html entities

2015-08-02  Dirk Frederickx (brushed AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.10.2-svn-29

       Some more Haddock template "tweaks":

       * Hide the attach & info navigation menu's for non-existing page

       * Improved the Info dropdown when no Author page exists.

       * Section titles remain visible, even with a sticky navigation menu.
         Eg. when clicking a table of contents entry, you should end up
         with a visible section header just below the sticky menu line.

       * Fixed: the top border of a TABLE was gone.

       * Added a version check on the user-preference cookie to be more robust ico changes.
         (hopefully no more cookie clean-up is needed when upgrading JSPWiki)

       * Sidebar:
         - The sidebar height now extends till the bottom of the page
         - 3 Sidebar modes are now working: left(default), right and hidden

       * Fixed the <wiki:Link> tag to support "cssClass" as attribute.

       * [JSPWIKI-430] All confirmation dialogs are now build with regular DOM elements.
         (check out the Log-out or Delete confirmation dialogs to see the improvement)


       WYSIWYG editors:

       * Added support for the WYSIWYG editor TinyMCE.jsp

       * Improved server side handling of HtmlStringToWiki translation

       * [JSPWIKI-622] Added an editor selection switch to the editor toolbar.
         It is now possible to switch between editors (plain, or other installed
         wysiwyg editors) while in Edit. (no need to go first via the Preferences screen)



2015-07-26  Dirk Frederickx (brushed AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.10.2-svn-28

       Haddock Template commit of the remaining JSP's: UI for handling groups,
       workflow UI, and refactored JSP's for Login/Lostpw/Register.
       This concludes the re-design of all the haddock template JSP's.

       Other changes:

       * Fixed page redirections and improved the back button handling.
         Eg. Attachment DELETE will get you now back to the ATTACH view,
         not the INFO view.  See also [JSPWIKI-867]

       * Tabs & Accordion toggles can now include other markup, rather than only text.

       * Added CSS3-based automatic text hyphenation for browsers who support this.
         (also works with none justified text)

       * Attachment Upload UI improved: attachment types are represented by icons
         from the icon-font.

       * Attachment Info page to access version information on attachments
         should now be more user-friendly, with an extra INFO action button.
         (iso a hidden link via the version number)



2015-07-16  Dirk Frederickx (brushed AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.10.2-svn-27

       More Haddock Template tweaks:

       * Removed annoying scroll-bars from the dropdown menu's which appeared in some browsers

       * Improved rendering of inserted dropdown's like the MoreMenu and HomeMenu,
         to make them better fit with bootstrap dropdown menu's.

       * Few fixes of the layout of the UserPreferences menu, and some refactoring
         of the UserPreferences.jsp and the Login.jsp.

       * Fixed an editor bug causing the Live Preview to slow down after some time.

       WYSIWYG editor in JSPWiki

       * Refreshed the WYSIWIG editor with the latest stable version of the
         CKeditor v4.5.1. (replacement of FCK) Standard version, with BootstrapCK4 skin.
         The update was done for both for the default and the Haddock template.
         FFS: server side translation from wiki-markup to HTML needs more work.
         ( WysiwygEditingRenderer.getString() often crashes )


2015-07-13  Juan Pablo Santos (juanpablo AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.10.2-svn-26

       * 2.10.2-svn-25

       * [JSPWIKI-896] Haddock template – user preferences are not saved.
         haddock-pref.js was not properly included into the build, due to lowercase
         issue in wro-haddock.xml.

       * [JSPWIKI-518] Saving after editing a section will return you to that  section.
         Fixed missing commits on wiki.js. Should work now.

       * Fixed issue with Accesskey

       * [JSPWIKI-433] Allow back button for TAB keys.
         It is now also possible to click a link to a hidden pane of a tabbed section
         (eg from the Table Of Contents) to automatically open that TAB pane.

       * Added a "title" attribute to the pagename in the header.  In case a very long
         pagename is truncated (with ellipsis ...) you can still see the full
         pagename when you hover the mouse over the pagename.

       This is the second major check-in of the HADDOCK template, with
       fixes and improvements mainly related to the plain editor.

       * Livepreview has been fixed, with ajax based on the fly page rendering.

         Indentation also works when selecting multiple lines.

       * You can use shift+Enter to quickly insert line-breaks. (\\)


       Fixing following editor related JIRA tickets :

       * [JSPWIKI-382]  Remove posteditor.js

       * [JSPWIKI-482]  Wrong insert from the suggestion box

       * [JSPWIKI-443]  Full screen editor.
         Added a collapsible sidebar, and a side-by-side display of the live-preview area.

       * [JSPWIKI-336]  section selection box not working properly. Fixed.

       * Fixed the User-Preference page-unload event.


       Other changes :

       * Added a info drop-down menu with a summary of the page-info.
         This is similar to page-footer section, but now accessible at the top of the page.

       * Replacing all *.png based icons by an icon font.  (eg. slimbox, filter, rss-feed )

       * Various small fixes on the HADDOCK template (jsp/css/js) :

       * Fixing %%category dropdowns which were clipped when inside a %%accordion.
         Replacing js based animation by2.10.1-svn-12 css3 animation to show/hide the popup.

       * Fixing bug when saving the Preferences (detected by Harry)

       * Changed fixed-width layout into fluid layout, occupying all screen real-estate.
         (this could become a user-preference setting in the future)
         Slightly decreasing the size of the sidebar.

       * 2.10.1-svn-6

       * Fixing the JSONRPCMAnager.emitJSONCall(..) so that it now renders
         the correct JSON RPC invocation javascript.

         You can test the RPCSamplePlugin like this:

              [{RPCSamplePlugin

              test
              }]

		 We are still getting error-code: 490, "No permission to access this AJAX method!"
         when invoking a plugin generated json-rpc call.


2014-02-14  Dirk Frederickx (brushed AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.10.1-svn-5

         Introducing the HADDOCK template, a new template/ui for Apache JSPWiki.

         This template contains various UI improvements and JSP simplifications,
         a major redesign of the JSPWiki CSS stylesheet based on BOOTSTRAP
         (now modularly build with LESS) and a rework of the javascript routines
         based on mootools v1.4.x. (also the js is now split into modular class files)

         Be aware: this is a first commit -- expect things to be broken.
         More work is needed on the plain editor; the Group UI is to be fixed.
         Validation has been done against Safari, Chrome & FF;  IE testing is left
         to the adventurous user.

         HADDOCK lives peacefully next to the default template. To activate the new
         template, add following line to your jspwiki-custom.properties:

              jspwiki.templateDir = haddock


       * [JSPWIKI-504] New default look for 3.0

       * [JSPWIKI-431] Attachment Upload, support upload of multiple files, drag&drop,
              improved progress bars.
              However the server functionality to upload multiple files is
              currently broken. FFS

       * [JSPWIKI-432] Simplify Tabbed Section Markup
              Still maintaining backwards compatibility with the current %%tabbedSection
              markup.

       * [JSPWIKI-712] Entites in ChangeNote should be decoded with "keep editing"

       * [JSPWIKI-797] Refactoring the JSPWiki javascript routines, upgrade js libs:
               mootools-core-1.4.5
               mootools-more-1.4.0.1
               prettify (dd. 4 mar 2013)

       * [JSPWIKI-798] Refactoring the JSPWiki main CSS stylesheet -
               now based on the BOOTSTRAP CSS Framework

       * [JSPWIKI-430] DOM based popups to replace regular js alert or prompt dialog boxes
               Also the edit/clone UI has been refactored.
               Some delete confirmation dialog boxes are still to be converted.

       * [JSPWIKI-429] Improved SLIMBOX to support Youtube, flash and other formats.
                You can now also 'slimbox' another wiki-page or an external url.
                Based on this media viewer, also a %%carousel style has been added.

       * [JSPWIKI-478] Remember cookies of collapsible for all contexts
                Collapsible lists and boxes have been refactored, and styled with BOOTSTRAP.
                In general, all %%dynamic-styles are re-styled with BOOTSTRAP css components.

       * [JSPWIKI-693] style issues

       * [JSPWIKI-463] display error in default template

       * [JSPWIKI-449] Menuhide functionality is illogical
                The sidebar (aka Favorites) can be shown/hidden via a toggle button.
                By default, the sidebar is hidden in the Edit/Comment view, to give
                maximum square-meters to the edit text-area.

       * [JSPWIKI-512] CSS Error with Firefox 2.0.20

       *  Upgrade wro4j to latest version 1.7.3

2014-01-07  Harry Metske (metskem@apache.org)

       * 2.10.0-svn-67

       * PropertyReader was using context.log for its logging. Every user changing his prefs is causing
         6 lines of logging to stdout which is cumbersome to get rid of. Changing this to log4j logging
         and offering a way to use an external log4j.properties file so PropertyReader can use log4j
         right away. (The cascaded property reading mechanism does not support "suppressing" properties
         from the ini/jspwiki.properties, only overriding)

2014-01-07  Harry Metske (metskem@apache.org)

       * Moved MassiveRepositoryTest to surefire plugin exclusion test to speed
         up build.

       * Moved wro4j-maven-plugin from compile to prepare-package phase so
         people can run mvn test, mvn test -Dtest=xxxxTest, etc. without needing
         to trigger wro4j each time.  (A nice sanity saver.)

       * Simpler error messages when JDBC*DatabaseTest fail due to DB being
         unavailable.

       * decoupled o.a.w.util from o.a.w, cfr. with $SVN/jspwiki-war/src/main/config/2.10-API.txt
         for details

       * wikipages for each language are zipped in their respective submodule

       * removed remaining build.xml from war submodule, all artifacts are generated from maven now

2013-12-15  Juan Pablo Santos (juanpablo AT apache DOT org)

         being used by Install.jsp

2013-12-01  Juan Pablo Santos (juanpablo AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.10.0-svn-50

       * Broke cycle between o.a.w.parser and o.a.w.api.engine packages:
       ** added public Pattern getPluginPattern() to o.a.w.api.engine.PluginManager
       ** moved PluginContent parsePluginLine( WikiContext context, String commandline, int pos ) from
          o.a.w.api.engine.PluginManager to equivalent-static method on o.a.w.parser.PluginContent
       ** deleted deprecated public static boolean isPluginLink( String link ) from o.a.w.api.engine.PluginManager,
          consider using equivalent method on o.a.w.parser.JSPWikiMarkupParser

2013-11-30  Harry Metske (metskem@apache.org)

       * Lucene upgraded to 4.6, minor upgrades on plugin versions

2013-11-25  Harry Metske (metskem@apache.org)

       * 2.10.0-svn-47

       * 2.10.0-svn-45

       * fixed JSPWIKI-792, replace opensymphony's oscache with ehcache

2013-08-25  Glen Mazza (gmazza AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.10.0-svn-44

       * Added jspwiki.login.throttling (default true, as in Java code) to default jspwiki.properties

       * Removed unnecessary config from IT test's jspwiki-custom.properties.

2013-08-24  Glen Mazza (gmazza AT apache DOT org)

       * No revision number (IT tests change only)

       * jspwiki-it-test-container-jdbc test now working, so all five IT test submodules are working
         (except for RenameProfile which fails with all tests).

       * renamed the two "container" tests to more descriptive "cma" (container-managed authentication).

2013-08-22  Glen Mazza (gmazza AT apache DOT org)

       * No revision number (IT tests change only)

       * For IT tests switched to Brian Matthew's inmemdb-maven-plugin used by Roller, creates an in-memory
         HSQLDB database with a lifespan that of the IT tests themselves (so no Ant tasks and no DB drop
         scripts needed).

       * jspwiki-it-test-custom-jdbc test now working, only one still not operative is -container-jdbc,
         which is up from 0 to 25 percent working.

2013-08-22  Glen Mazza (gmazza AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.10.0-svn-43

       * Changed jspwiki.propertyfile.cascade to jspwiki.custom.cascade to emphasize cascading is done
         on top of new jspwiki-custom.properties file if present, the default properties file only if not
         present.

       * Changed some internal constants from "propertyfile" to "custom" so they more accurately reflect
         their meaning in 2.10.

2013-08-17  Glen Mazza (gmazza AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.10.0-svn-42

       * Updated code from using org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver to org.hsqldb.jdbc.JDBCDriver

       * Switched from inaccurate NoRequiredPropertyException to somewhat better WikiSecurityException
         for database errors in JDBCGroup/UserDatabase (former was giving confusing error messages
         when the underlying problem was just DB-related).

       * More work in IT tests, for JDBC tests to become operative again (not yet finished).

       * Renamed HsqlDbUtils to HsqlDBUtilsIT in it-tests, to fully ensure HsqlDBUtils in jspwiki-war
         isn't being run instead.

2013-08-15  Glen Mazza (gmazza AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.10.0-svn-41

       * Removed "incubator" from JSPWiki taglib URI, removed deprecated in 2004 RSSLinkTag

       * Some simplifications to web.xml put in, taking advantage of 2.5 web.xml format.

2013-08-15  Glen Mazza (gmazza AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.10.0-svn-40

       * Removed unneeded config files in Selenium IT module, changed its packaging to WAR
         and its parent to the it tests folder.  JDBC tests still inoperative, but others
         working as before.

       * Removed jdbc.properties file in favor of configuring it in jspwiki-custom.properties.

       * jspwiki.policy file in test updated to more recent structure used by the integrated
         tests module, subsequently removed from latter as it's unneeded there.

2013-08-14  Glen Mazza (gmazza AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.10.0-svn-39

       * Cleaned out unused config in IT tests, centralized common config
         to Selenium IT module's custom properties file.

       * Patches to the three non-JDBC IT tests made so they're now all running
         except for one test (RenameProfile), two JDBC IT tests still inoperative.

       * Removed config references to long-discontinued "jspwiki.admin.user" value.

2013-08-13  Glen Mazza (gmazza AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.10.0-svn-38

       * Updated all the test/*-custom.properties files, removed all non-necessary configuration items

       * Removed no-longer-needed file filtering from the jspwiki WAR pom.

2013-08-11  Glen Mazza (gmazza AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.10.0-svn-37

       * Updated it-test's selenium module to use new jspwiki-custom.properties system.  IT tests only
         working 50% presently (same as before though).

       * Removed some values from our jspwiki-custom.properties files where the defaults in jspwiki.properties
         are sufficient.

2013-08-09  Glen Mazza (gmazza AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.10.0-svn-36

       * Introducted new jspwiki-custom.properties file, which can be placed in test/resources for JUnit tests
         or externally to the WAR (for Tomcat, $CATALINA_HOME/lib) and will be picked up automatically by
         JSPWiki.  Only those elements that you're changing from default src/main/resources/ini/jspwiki.properties
         need addition to the custom properties file.  I still need to convert the Selenium tests to the new format.

       * Renamed jspwiki.properties, _rcs.properties, and _vers.properties file with new -custom suffix in src/test/resources
         (can be named anything as JUnit tests hardcode the names).  Removed elements that are the same as those
         in the default jspwiki.properties file.

2013-08-08  Glen Mazza (gmazza AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.10.0-svn-35

       * Partial revert of Jetty to v. 8.1.12 so it can still run with the JDK 6 used by Jenkins.

2013-08-07  Glen Mazza (gmazza AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.10.0-svn-34find

       * Upgrade from Jetty used in unit test cases from v. 7.6.7 to v. 9.0.4

2013-08-06  Juan Pablo Santos (juanpablo AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.10.0-svn-33

       * JSPWIKI-799: jenkins build fails because of SearchManagerTest. It was reusing the same page directory
         as other tests, indexing pages created on other tests, depending on the test execution order.

       * Use of Lucene 4.4 *Fields on LuceneSearchProvider to instantiate Fields, instead of using deprecated
         constructor + Field.Index

2013-08-04  Harry Metske (metskem@apache.org)

       * 2.10.0-svn-32

       * first guess in fixing JSPWIKI-799 TestEngine.emptyWorkdir() cleans another directory the the one used by the test ?

2013-08-01  Dirk Frederickx (brushed AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.10.0-svn-27

       * JSPWIKI-761 : Implementing the WRO4J ( Web Resource Optimizer for Java ) Build-time solution
       through the wro4j maven plugin.
          - replacing YUI-Compressor for JS by UglifyJS (better compression)
          - introducing the LESS CSS preprocessor supporting advanced css authoring capabilities (variables, mixins, ...)
          - merging JS and CSS files to reduce the number of resources needed at page-load.

       You can now build with or without minification of the JS and CSS files to ease development
       by using -Dminimize = true | false. (ref. mvn_cheat-sheet.txt)

         options)

       * Updated google-code-prettify's JS to latest 2013 version.

         i18n stuff removed from build.xml, HSQLDB now

         prior to running any of the Ant tasks, in
         order to download the necessary libs.

       * Added maven-eclipse-plugin to pom.xml to create necessary
         Eclipse .project/.settings/.classpath settings upon calling

       * Switched to a hardcoded jdbc.properties file for testing to simplify build.xml and future

               + consider using PluginContent.executeParse(WikiContext) instead
           - WikiPlugin newWikiPlugin( String pluginName, ResourceBundle rb ) is now public and part
             of the org.apache.wiki.api.engine.PluginManager API

         hardcoded /p/dir1/dir2.If jspwiki.fileSystemProvider.pageDir in jspwiki.properties isn't
         provided, it will default to ${user.home}/jspwiki-files

       * new API package org.apache.wiki.api.engine, intended to hold WikiEngine, its managers and
         related classes. FilterManager and PluginManager moved there (cfr. JSPWIKI-155, JSPWIKI-303
         and $SVN/trunk/doc/2.10-API.txt).

       * org.apache.wiki.FileUtil and org.apache.wiki.TextUtil Moved to equivalent classes under

       * Corrected the displayed version of commons-httpclient, we are downloading 3.1, but it was
         named 3.0.1 (it is needed to either delete commons-httpclient-3.0.1.jar or run ant
         clean-deps to ensure that the old jar goes away)

       * Some minor refactors to expose generified collections at Acl and AclEntry, and adding
         missing serialVersionUID at org.apache.wiki.workflow

2013-01-06  Harry Metske <metskem@apache.org>

         for container managed auth).
         Required fixes:
           - TestContainer now binds the jdbc/UserDatabase jdbc/GroupDatabase in Jetty's namespace
           - Logout webtest checks for the specific JSPWikiAssertedName cookie
           - build.xml was missing a lot of tasks and macros, required to properly startup hsqldb (don't know how/why)
           - JDBCGroupDatabase : NamingExceptions do not have a cause, we now log the exception itself
           - removed the semicolon from the License in .ddl files (they cause syntax errors)

2012-12-26  Juan Pablo Santos (juanpablo AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.9.1-svn-8
