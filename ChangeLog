2003-01-08  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * Added CalendarTag.  It's still in its very infancy, so it might
        not be very useful to others.

2003-01-05  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.0.12.

        * Diff.jsp did not use the templateDir property correctly.  Oops.
        Reported by Steven Noels, I think.

        * Added Expires, Last-Modified, and Cache-Control headers to
        Edit.jsp responses - this should allow certain versions of
        Internet Explorer to use Preview correctly.  Suggested by Richard
        Donkin.

        * Implemented page "locking".  When you now start to edit a page,
        the page is marked as being under editing, and the next guy will
        get a warning about that.  To facilitate this, Edit.jsp was
        changed.  Also, check out the new tags in "EditTemplate.jsp", and
        note also that the "Cancel" is now a button instead of a link.
        Suggested by Olli Lounela.

2003-01-03  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * Wrote some new documentation into sample wikipages.

        * v2.0.11.

        * All boolean type properties in jspwiki.properties recognize now
        "on" and "yes" as "true" as well.

        * It is now possible to allow raw HTML on WikiPages.  Beware, this
        is a very dangerous option, since it will allow people OTHER THAN
        THE ADMINISTRATOR to make wikis that can hurt users.  Requested
        (very loudly and many times :-) by Alain Ravet.

        * v2.0.10.

        * WeblogPlugin changed entry formats.  Beware, if you've been
        using it so far. 

        * WikiPage now implements Cloneable.  I have no idea why.

2002-12-29  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.0.9.

        * Added permalinks to WeblogPlugin.

        * IndexPlugin enhanced to have parameters "include" and "exclude",
        which can be used to include or exclude pages using standard glob
        wild card expressions (*, ?, etc).

2002-12-28  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.0.8.

        * Bug fix: VersioningFileProvider would mangle old versions of a
        page if they were in UTF-8 format.  Reported by Torsten
        Hildebrandt. 

2002-12-18  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.0.7.

        * Added new title beautifier code from Torsten Hildebrandt.  It's
        a bit different from what we used to have, but it does now less
        mistakes.  :-).

2002-12-16  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.0.6 - The I Should Really Be Sleeping But Let's See If Killer
        Can Keep Up With This Pace With His Debian Packages -release.

        * Inspiration continues.  Now ReferenceManager also understands
        about attachments, so they can now be cross-referenced, be on
        unused or undefined pages, etc.

2002-12-15  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.0.5.

        * RecentChanges now displays also changed attachments.  This added
        some new APIs in WikiAttachmentProvider and AttachmentManager.

        * v2.0.4.

        * Bug fix: Restoring previous versions from archive did not work.

        * Bug fix: Attempting to upload a non-existing file would cause a
        crash.  Reported by Alain Ravet and Paul Downes.

2002-12-14  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.0.3.

        * Bug fix: previewing a new page with a footnote would cause a
        crash. 

        * Added WikiAttachments page to the samplepage distro.
        
        * Redirected all references to Wiki.jsp or Edit.jsp through
        WikiEngine for future configurability.  Requested by Bart
        Selders.

        * Running tests now puts test pages into /tmp/testrepository.  Too
        many false alerts due to wrong files in /tmp/...

        * v2.0.2.

        * Bug fix: JSPWiki no longer dies horribly with OutOfMemoryError
        if preformatted code blocks ({{{ }}}) are not closed properly.
        We simply forgot to check for EOF :-).  Reported by Erik Bunn.

        * Bug fix: CamelCase is no longer recognized inside {{{ }}}
        blocks. Reported by Torsten Hildebrandt.

2002-12-11  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.0.1.

        * Attachments are now sent back using Content-Disposition: inline
        instead of Content-Disposition: attachment.  This means that they
        should now be opened automatically by browsers.  Suggested by
        Torsten Hildebrandt.

        * Interwiki references that lead out of the wiki are now also
        tagged with the outlink image.  Reported by Alain Ravet.

        * Outlink images are now on by default.

2002-12-09  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.0.0-alpha.

        * Fixed WikiEngine.beautifyTitle() to work better with acronyms.

        * Moved GoRankAggregator and GoDiagram plugins into their own,
        separate project. 

2002-12-09  Erik Bunn  <Erik.Bunn@basen.net>

        * v1.9.50.
        
        * Fixed null reference bug in AttachmentManager when no
        manager specified in jspwiki.properties.
        
        * Added Error.jsp, which displays the message of an 
        exception using DisplayMessage.jsp (in templates).
        Added Error.jsp as error page of all top level jsp's.

2002-12-08  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.9.49.

        * All referral plugins (UnusedPages,UndefinedPages, and
        ReferringPagesPlugin) now support a parameter "separator", which
        basically contains the wiki markup that should be used to separate
        the entires.  Suggested by Jeremy Cowgar.

2002-12-08  Erik Bunn  <Erik.Bunn@basen.net>

        * Modified exception classes to inherit WikiException
        (with the exception of InternalWikiException =).
        
        * Added SecurityException in preparation for auth merge.

2002-12-07  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.9.48.

        * Tiny little tweaks to attachments all around.

        * PageInfo is now attachment-aware, so you can view older
        versions, etc. using the standard PageInfo link.

        * If an attachment is an image, then it is automatically inlined.

        * It is now possible to link to attachments as if they were normal
        Wiki pages.  From the page itself, just use [attachment name],
        from other pages, use [ParentPage/attachment name].

        * v1.9.47.

        * CamelCase links now finally work (or at least all tests run).
        Thanks to Joonas Iivonen for inspiration, and listening my
        incoherent explanation about the problem. :-)

        * List items (*, #) are now closed properly as per XHTML spec.
        We still have paragraphs to go, but otherwise we're nearly XHTML
        compliant. 

2002-12-06  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.9.46.

        * Major import of all attachments code.  This version is actually
        able to upload/download attachments, but I wouldn't use this for
        any real production.  The structure may change and you may face a
        difficult process to migrate your old attachments to a new
        system.  

        * Added attachment_big.png, thanks to Tero Tiittanen.

        * v1.9.45.

        * Many changes to GoRankAggregator, which you probably won't care
        about. 

        * Added fix for JBoss and pure WAR-file deployment from Xyvind
        Lxkling.

2002-12-05  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.9.44.

        * CamelCase detection changed yet again.  However, this will still
        fail when you write wikimarkup right next to it: For example
        __CamelCase__ will result into something totally strange, much
        like *CamelCase to start a line.  Using whitespace should work,
        though...  __ CamelCase __ should be quite okay.

2002-12-04  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.9.43.

        * Bug fix: TranslatorReader did not properly closed down the <img>
        -tags, as per XHTML specification.  Let's see how many old
        browsers break this time... :-)

        * Bug fix: Preformatted text was not properly closed down if the
        user forgot all about it.  Reported by Bob Schulze.

        * Bug fix: Preformatted text ({{{) no longer allows you to input
        HTML.  Reported by Bob Schulze.

        * New option: jspwiki.translatorReader.useOutlinkImage allows you
        to mark all outgoing links with a small picture.  Thanks to Teemu
        HirsimÂŽäki for providing with the idea and the image.  Look for
        images/out.png, if you want to change it.

2002-12-01  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * GoRankAggregator now also supports 'egfurl' parameter, which
        fetches country-specific ranking data from persons.  Quite
        kludgish at the moment.

        * Hopefully fixed GoRankAggregator to allow multiple persons of
        the same rank.

2002-11-29  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * Added GoRankAggregator.  Most of you don't probably care.  (I
        probably should make these a separate distribution or something.)
        I won't even bother to bump the version number for this one.

2002-11-26  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.9.42.

        * Fixed a near-fatal bug in UserPreferences.jsp - we wrote the
        page contents into the stream and then did a redirect.  Oops.

        * Radical change warning: If you are running a Wiki with that has
        authentication turned on, note that from now on the username set
        in UserPreferences is the one that gets put in page change
        history, not the name the user used to authenticate himself.  This
        was done so that it would be easier to maintain a wiki that has
        only a single username/password combination and still track the
        users.   I believe this is more in line with WikiNature.
        
        You can still see the name the user used to authenticate in the
        log file that JSPWiki generates.

        * v1.9.41.

        * Fixed EditTemplate.jsp to show the link to EditPageHelp in a
        manner consistent with other edit links.

        * EditLinkTag would crash if the page it was referring to did not
        exist.  Reported by Torsten Hildebrand.

        * Fixed camelcase patch from Jeff Phillips - thanks Jeff!

2002-11-24  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.9.40.

        * Instead of doing ServletContext.getRealPath("/") we now use the
        ServletContext itself as an unique key when creating a
        WikiEngine.  This should resolve problems when running JSPWiki
        straight from a WAR file.  Reported by Oyvind Loekling.

        * Added plenty of code for attachments.  Storing and retrieving
        works, as well as listing.  However, uploading still has some
        problems. 

2002-11-20  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.9.39.

        * DiffLink now fails gracefully if page does not exist.  Reported
        by Jeremy C.
        
        * Fixed ~ -escaping of CamelCase links.

        * Added patch from Kabe Robichaux to fix a problem with older RCS
        programs that do not support the -z flag.

        * v1.9.38.

        * The "&" translation now occurs _before_ other entities, which no
        longer causes all quotes to be transformed back into "&quot;"
        while you're editing a page.

        * Integrated camelcase patch from Jeff Phillips.  It is now nearly
        working - a couple more tests should go through first.

2002-11-11  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.9.37.

        * <BR/> is now <BR />, in order not to confuse some older
        browsers.

2002-11-09  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.9.36.

        * GoDiagram now uses PNG images.  It also now honors the baseURL
        setting.

        * Tables now close the <TD> tag correctly with </TD>, thanks to
        the new TranslatorReader architecture.  Reported by Andreas
        Rozek.

        * "&" is now translated into "&amp;" when editing, so that you can
        actually input HTML entities and they stay like that when going
        into storage.  Reported by Erik Bunn and others.

        * Tilde (~) now escapes bars in tables.

        * v1.9.35.

        * GoDiagram is now a bit more tolerant towards the kind of markup
        it accepts.

        * Bug fix: godiagram was off-by-one towards the side of the
        board.  Reported by Paavo Pietarila.

2002-11-08  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * We now output <BR/> instead of <BR>.  Slowly working towards
        full XHTML :-).

        * Several small bugfixes: ([[ not working, single {'s getting
        destroyed, etc.)

        * Removed clear=all from HR, added \\\ to do a <br clear=all>.  HR
        looked quite odd.

        * ":" after the first no longer breaks description lists.        

        * v1.9.34.

        * ---- aka HR tag now adds 'clear=all' attribute to accommodate
        aligned images, such as the ones produced by GoDiagram.

        * GoDiagram now works.

2002-11-07  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.9.33.

        * New plugin: GoDiagram.

        * A couple of bugfixes: some EOL issues in multi-line plugins.

2002-11-07  Erik Bunn  <Erik.Bunn@nospam.memecry.net>

        * Added plugin execution disabling, and disabled 
        their execution during the initial reference manager scan.
        This is mainly important in wiki's with lots of complex custom
        plugins.
        
2002-11-07  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.9.32.

        * True multiline plugins that no longer conflict with WikiMarkup
        are now available!  Yay!

        * MAJOR breakdown!  Rewrote practically everything in
        TranslatorReader: it is now fully stream-based instead of
        line-based, which makes many things quite a lot easier.  It should
        also be quite a lot faster than before.  
        
        CamelCase links are TOTALLY broken in this revision, since the
        stream-based system makes it a bit difficult to run the regexp on
        them.  We'll see how to get them back running again.
        
        Do NOT use this revision for any production work... We have many
        tests that still fail!

2002-11-06  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.9.31.

        * More attachment support.  Still not functional, but at least now
        you can see where we're going.

        * Fixed support for multiline plugins.

2002-11-01  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.9.30.

        * The INSERT is no longer required to signify plugins.  It is
        recommended, but not required.  This at the request of many people
        who are using an insane amount of plugins :-).

        * New plugin: Counter.

        * Added support to VariableManager to display Context Variables.

        * Added Wiki Context Variables.  These exist solely in the
        WikiContext class, and allow you to define transient variables on
        a pageview basis.

        * Added a patch to allow multiline plugins from ebu.
        Unfortunately, this does not work fully yet - newlines in the
        middle of arguments break stuff.

2002-10-29  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.9.29.

        * Added a new property: "jspwiki.frontPage".  This allows you to
        easily change the default page name from "Main" into something
        else.  This is important if you're doing localized installations,
        for example.

2002-10-23  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.9.28.

        * Just incorporated a bit more attachment stuff.  Also fixed the
        problem of AttachmentManager complaining at startup, if no
        attachmentProvider was defined.

2002-09-30  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.9.27.

        * CamelCase links can now be stopped from occurring by prepending
        it with '~'.  ~CamelCase results in "CamelCase", not a link to a
        page called CamelCase.  '~' will from now on be a generic negator
        tool for all sorts of purposes.

2002-09-29  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.9.26.

        * Added the ability to restore older versions of pages relatively
        trivially.  This is done by going viewing the old version via
        PageInfo, then clicking on "Restore this version".  You'll be
        presented with a edit view to the page.
        
        Note: this facility has changed the default template, too, so if
        you have made your own templates, you probably want to modify them
        too to allow this facility.

2002-09-17  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.9.25.

        * Viewing of old versions would not show the "this is version XX"
        -banner because of an unclosed JSP comment.  Oops.

        * PageInfo now shows "no versions" if there is no version history
        available instead of an empty string.

        * HistoryIteratorTag would fail if there was no version history
        (like when you were moving from FileSystemProvider to
        RCSFileProvider).  Now fixed.

        * CachingProvider now checks if the requested version is cached,
        and not only when the version is marked as latest.  Combined with
        the new template system, this bug caused CachingProvider to
        effectively ignore its own cache.

        * ---- aka HR is now <HR /> as per XHTML spec.

2002-09-15  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.9.24.

        * Exceptions from plugins is now clearly separated from WikiEngine
        internals.  Suggested by Niilo Neuvo.

2002-09-08  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * JSPWiki repository should now have anonymous CVS access.
        Everything should now work.

        * v1.9.23.

        * Bug fix: no longer crashes if baseURL is not defined.  Reported
        by Alain Ravet.

        * Fixed a problem when trying to escape '[' character using '[['.

2002-09-07  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.9.22.

        * SearchResult uses now "WikiPage" instead of a String to the page
        name.  Heed this, if you have your own implementation of a
        provider.

        * VariableTag now has a "default" attribute which gets invoked if
        the variable in question does not exist.

        * The top right search box didn't work - now it does.

        * You can now limit the number of hits a search returns - see
        FindContent.jsp and the maxItems parameter of SearchResultIterator
        tag.

        * Search.jsp also tagified.

        * UserPreferences now directs you back to the prefs page instead
        of Wiki.jsp.

        * UserPreferences now check the validity of the given username,
        and will turn it into a valid WikiName.

        * UserPreferences.jsp is now also tagified (to some extent
        anyway) and should now work.

2002-09-03  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.9.21

        * Bug fix: Two plugins on the same line would not always work as
        expected.  I had to rewrite the entire
        TranslatorReader.insertHyperLinks() method... As a nice side
        effect, it's now like five times faster than before. :-)
        
        * Added a simple WeblogPlugin and an accompanying
        WeblogEntryPlugin.

        * It is now possible to add jspwiki.properties properties as
        WikiVariables. 

        * Documented WikiVariables.

2002-09-02  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * Added new tag "Plugin", which allows you to run any JSPWiki
        plugin from a JSP page directly.

        * Fixed the last failing RCSFileProvider test case.

2002-09-01  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.9.20.

        * Added a new variable system, including an all-new
        VariableManager.  For example, "applicationname" tag was removed
        as obsolete.  You may add variables using a [{$foobar}] -notation
        on wiki pages, and with the wiki:Variable tag on the JSP pages.
        
        * PageModified.jsp and Preview.jsp are now included in the new
        template system.
        
        * SystemInfo.jsp is now removed.  A page called "SystemInfo" is
        taking its place.

        * Creating new pages should work now again.
        
        * Edit.jsp should no longer crash.  It's also been delegated
        properly into EditTemplate.jsp.

        * Added jspwiki.templateDir property.

        * Fixed PageInfo display - it now actually generates correct
        links. 

        * Fixed DiffLinkTag to actually generate correct links.

2002-08-29  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.9.19.

        * Plenty of changes to the JSP pages: created 8 new tags, shuffled
        things around.  Everything is still broken, but doc/Templates.txt
        should explain what we're about to do.

2002-08-19  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.9.18.

        * Moved stuff around, as plural forms of page names were not
        considered to exist by many of the internal routines, confusing
        UndefinedPages for example.  Found by Leigh Dodds.

2002-08-18  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.9.17.

        * All of the pages should now work.

        * Added Translate tag for writing Wiki content directly from the
        page.

        * Non-existing pages would crash both Wiki.jsp and Edit.jsp.  Now
        fixed.  Reported by Alain Ravet.

        * v1.9.16.

        * ViewTemplate.jsp is now done totally in tags.

        * Diff.jsp is now done totally in tags.

        * Added new tags: CheckVersion, InsertDiff, PageExists,
        PageVersion, PageDate.

2002-08-17  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.9.15.

        * Added a couple of new tags.

        * Moved all CSS files and cssinclude.js into the templates/default
        directory.

        * Split Edit.jsp and PageInfo.jsp into a scriptlet page, and a
        HTML template.  Some pages still do not work yet.

2002-08-16  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.9.14.

        * Moved the current view templates to templates/defaults.  This
        probably broke quite a lot of stuff...

2002-08-09  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.9.13.

        * JSPWiki now writes a better separator to log when it starts to
        make it easier to see new log entires.  Suggested by Mikael
        Honkala.

2002-08-01  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.9.12.

        * Added PageInfoLink tag.

2002-07-31  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.9.11.

        * Even more JSP tags added, including a new "Permission" tag.

2002-07-25  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.9.10.
        
        * Forgot to call link mutators with CamelCase links.  This caused
        CamelCase links disappearing from things like "Referenced by"
        -list.  Reported by Alain Ravet.

        * Added ';term:def' to TextFormattingRules for definition lists.
        This incidentally also allows you to make comments into someone
        else's text, if you use an empty 'term' (;:<Comment here>).

2002-07-24  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>
        
        * v1.9.9.

        * Moved LeftMenu, LeftMenuFooter, PageHeader into templates/.

        * Added new WikiPages: PageIndex, EditPageHelp.

        * Moved Edit.jsp embedded help into a WikiPage called
        "EditPageHelp".

        * Bug fix: In rare occasions VersioningFileProvider would not
        return correct page information.

        * More JSP tags implemented.

        * Added new plugin "IndexPlugin", by Alain Ravet.

2002-07-23  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.9.8. (The afternoon version.)

        * Changed the default Edit.jsp background to something else, since
        so many people are running with the default.  I told you it was
        ugly - I am not sure the new version is any better :-).

        * Moved ViewTemplate.jsp into templates/

        * Added AuthorTag.

        * v1.9.7.

        * Links to existing pages inside image links now generate an
        automatic link to that page.  Suggested by Alain Ravet.

2002-07-22  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.9.6.

        * Started the (painful) move to JSP tags.  Sigh.  I couldn't
        really figure out a better way - unfortunately we now have to
        stand with the performance penalty that JSP tags give us.  This
        includes new WikiTagBase class, which contains some helpers.

        * Split Wiki.jsp into Wiki.jsp and ViewTemplate.jsp.  All HTML
        code should go to the latter one.

        * Incorporated fix from 1.8.2: UserProfiles might be broken on
        some containers.  Reported by Kalle Kivimaa.

        * Incorporated fix from 1.8.2: new page diffs are now shown
        properly.  Reported by Niilo Neuvo.

2002-07-11  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.9.5.

        * Fixed problem with RSS generating illegal XML in certain cases
        (& and < were not translated to entities properly).

        * Fixed problem with plugin output getting translated by
        reordering the translator routines.  This may break many things,
        so please be careful.  Reported by Niilo Neuvo.

2002-07-07  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.9.4.

        * Fixed problem with VersioningFileProvider failing if the
        corresponding history file was not located.  This might have been
        an issue while upgrading from FileSystemProvider to
        VersioningFileProvider.

        * Moved some heavier stuff from tests to package "stresstests" to
        make running unit tests faster. 

2002-07-04  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.9.3

        * Fixed a serious problem with CamelCase links screwing up if you
        had more than two links on the same line.

2002-07-01  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.9.2

        * JSPWiki now supports traditional, CamelCase (or InterCapping)
        WikiLinks without square brackets.  However, this feature is
        turned off by default, so you'll have to edit the correct property
        in the jspwiki.properties file.

2002-06-30  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.9.1

        * Changed WikiEngine initialization so that it would better
        integrate with servlets and/or standalone systems.  However, this
        does not yet work as-expected, if you're using it, you'll see all
        sorts of annoying NullPointerExceptions if things go wrong.

        * Moved some of the functionality from WikiEngine into a new
        PageManager class.

        * Integrated some initial parts of the attachment package from
        ebu.  Does not work yet, though.

        * Did some code cleanup: We now have a proper WikiException (with
        our own exceptions extending from it).  There is now also a new
        WikiProvider interface, which WikiPageProvider and
        AttachmentProvider extend from.

        * You should no longer set CachingProvider directly, but to use
        jspwiki.usePageCache instead.  I did this change since in many bug
        reports it turned out that practically nobody was using the page
        cache - presumably because nobody knew about it :-).

2002-06-25  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * Branched off 1.9.x, which is to be 2.0.  This means that it's
        quite likely that anything from CVS is no longer functioning =).

        * You can now specify the used page provider without the package
        name in the jspwiki.properties file.

        * Major change: All WikiPageProviders now live in their own, neat
        little package.  This means that all jspwiki property files just
        broke, unfortunately.

2002-06-20  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.8.0.

        * A second property: jspwiki.matchEnglishPlurals automatically
        allows you to consider "Thing" and "Things" the same word.
        Unfortunately, it's not perfect (it can't tell the difference
        between SandBox and SandBoxes, for example).

        * PageHeader.jsp now splits the title into separate words, if the
        correct property is set in jspwiki.properties.  Suggested by
        Steven Owens.

        * PageModified.jsp now does word wrapping.  It's still not
        beautiful, but it works.

        * Links starting with "file:" are now recognized as external
        links, not interwiki links anymore.

        * InterWiki links no longer go through URLEncoder, because URL
        encoding removes things like slashes.  Which is annoying, and
        probably not you want.  You'll just now have to be more careful
        when writing InterWiki links.  Reported by GarethSB.

2002-06-09  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.7.10.

        * Added new property: jspwiki.plugin.searchPath, which allows you
        to add any package name for searching plugins.  Suggested by Niilo
        Neuvo.

        * RSS feed was fixed - we now also add the <items> list.  Changed
        also the dc:contributor field to use the rdf:Description element
        rather than the direct name, since it would not work with all RSS
        aggregators.

        * Wiki.jsp now displays the XML sign for easy subscription to the
        RSS feed.  We also display the Radio coffee mug for easy
        subscription for Radio Userland users (though this is untested,
        could any Radio folks test it, please?)

        * We now support RSS autodiscovery, as per the proposed standard
        at
        http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/06/02.html#important_change_to_the_link_tag.

2002-06-03  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * Oops, compiling broke on some systems due to undeclared
        exceptions.

2002-06-01  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * Feature: WikiEngine now remembers the ServletContext it was
        initialized with, and you can get it via
        WikiEngine.getServletContext().  Requested by Niilo Neuvo.

2002-05-31  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * Bug fix: in case the specified page directory does not exist,
        FileSystemProvider now throws an FileNotFoundException.  Suggested
        by Niilo Neuvo.

2002-05-22  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.7.9.

        * Hooray - JSPWiki is no longer dependant on RCS in any form.  We
        now have an internal diff routine courtesy of BMSI.  This means
        that on Windows you can just use the VersioningFileProvider and
        you no longer need to do anything with the RCS.

2002-05-19  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * UserPreferences now allows you to clear the preferences.
        Suggested by Robert McGovern, who kindly sent me a patch for it.

2002-05-11  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.7.8.

        * Added CurrentTimePlugin, which allows you to tell the server
        time.  Added documentation to JSPWikiPlugins, and also a sample to
        RecentChanges.

        * PluginManager also now understands quoted parameters, i.e. if
        you enclose a parameter value in single quotes ('), you can use
        spaces and other annoying creatures inside the parameter
        values. This is very handy for the CurrentTimePlugin.

        * PluginManager no longer needs the full package name, if the
        plugin is a JSPWiki-supplied plugin.  We first try with the class
        name as given, then prepend "com.ecyrd.jspwiki.plugin" and try
        again.  This should make putting plugins on your own page a bit
        simpler.

2002-05-09  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * Added temporary fix for misbehaving, nested #'s and *'s.
        However, this is not a real fix, it just prevents the system from
        going all wonky.  Reported by Mahlen Morris.

        * Fixed problem with XML-RPC interface method listLinks()
        generating incorrect HREF attribute for nonexistant links.
        Reported by Mahlen Morris.

2002-05-07  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.7.7.

        * Bug fix: UTF-8 version of XML-RPC client missed
        getRecentChanges() totally.  Apparently nobody was using it =).

        * Bug fix: RPC.getRecentChanges() would accidentally use local
        time instead of UTC.  Oops.  Found by Mahlen Morris.

2002-04-19  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.7.6.

        * RSS feed is now richer.  I also added MANY settings to
        jspwiki.properties, all starting with "jspwiki.rss".  It should
        allow you to configure pretty much everything related to the RSS
        feed.

2002-04-18  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * RSS feed is now generated in the proper directory.  If you're not
        running WikiEngine as a servlet, then the value of the "user.dir"
        system property (the current working directory) is used.

        * v1.7.5.

        * Added an initial stab at an RSS feed.  Currently it just lists
        the changed pages, but perhaps in the near future it can do more
        complex stuff.

2002-04-14  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.7.4.

        * UserPreferences is now a lot more tolerant towards UTF-8
        characters.

        * Everything rebuilt to survive a null author information.

        * The text for inline images is now interpreted as a hyperlink, if
        it starts with the usual http:, ftp:, mailto:, etc.  Suggested by
        Alain Ravet.

2002-03-27  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.7.3.

        * Added capability to set your user name via UserPreferences
        page.  This data is stored as a cookie in your browser.

2002-03-25  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.7.2.

        * When a page is saved, it gets now automatically normalized.
        This normalizing means that all pages will now end with a newline
        (some browsers send a newline and some don't), and also that ALL
        line breaks are now marked with \r\n (CRLF, MS-DOS style).  Why
        with that obsolete style?  Well, HTTP standard uses CRLF all
        around, and most of the current JSPWiki installations use CRLF in
        all of the files.  Also, most UNIX tools are smart enough to
        understand CRLF, whereas not all Windows tools understand plain
        CR (Mac style) or plain LF.  Using CRLF should make installing
        this upgrade totally visible to most users.
        
        Having said that, this has not been tested very many times,
        obviously.  Use with care :-).

2002-03-22  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.7.1.

        * Edit.jsp had a javascript error, pointing at a wrong form.  It
        was not fatal, it did not affect the user in any real way, other
        than being an annoyance.

        * DifferenceEngine no longer crashes if it gets empty lines from
        diff. 

2002-03-21  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * Added preview capability to Edit.jsp.  Suggested by many
        people.

        * Added Preview.jsp.  This is still a very simple preview, which
        does not allow you to do a direct publish.

2002-03-16  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.7.0.  Finally :-).

2002-03-10  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * Added VersioningFileProvider.  The VersioningFileProvider is
        STRICTLY ALPHA.  DO NOT USE IT FOR ANY REAL PROJECT.  But please,
        do test it :-).

        * v1.6.13-cvs.

        * getRecentChanges() XML-RPC method now hopefully does UTC
        conversion correctly.

        * Search.jsp now offers to search on Google as well after giving
        you the results.

        * Added plenty of documentation about the XML-RPC interface to the
        distribution.

        * Footnotes are now unique across Wiki.  This is accomplished by
        adding the page name to the anchor name.  Suggested by Mahlen
        Morris.

2002-03-07  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * Edit.jsp text editor now knows how to adjust its own width
        according to browser window width, if your browser knows CSS.
        Thanks to Matthew Simoneau for the tip.

        * Included a new version of xmlrpc.jar: this version just has the
        default charset set to "UTF-8" instead of ISO-Latin-1.

        * RPCServlet now takes two initParams: "handler" to point at the
        class that is used to handle the XML-RPC call, and "prefix" to
        determine the XML-RPC command prefix.  We use these to start both
        the UTF-8 and strict XML-RPC handlers from web.xml.

        * Added AbstractRPCHandler and RPCHandlerUTF8 classes so that we
        can now also serve XML-RPC using UTF-8 :-).

2002-02-25  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * XML-RPC listLinks now returns a the type as a string.  Suggested
        by Mahlen Morris.

        * XML-RPC listLinks now returns an extra parameter: href.  This
        contains the actual link text from the HTML page itself.
        Suggested by Mahlen Morris.

        * InterWiki references are now also added to the link of external
        links returned by listLinks().  They are returned as entire URLs,
        resulting from resolving the reference.

2002-02-24  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.6.12-beta.

        * Added XML-RPC command "listLinks".

        * Did some code reorganization: New class DifferenceEngine now
        handles all diffs.  This was done in preparation for internal diff
        handling.  Also, LinkCollector is now a class of its own.

        * XML-RPC Command prefix is now "wiki" instead of "jspwiki".

2002-02-23  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * XML-RPC interface no longer relies on overloading of method
        names: All versioned versions have now "Version" appended.
        Suggested by Les Orchard.

        * XML-RPC interface now returns an error code of 1, if the
        requested page does not exist.  Suggested by Les Orchard.

        * Bug fix: Now tables should finally work with Mozilla.

        * Added Google search as an Interwiki link.

        * Diff.jsp now shows if there has been no difference.

        * Bug fix: Interwiki links were cleaned accidentally.

2002-02-21  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * Ebu rearranged web.xml to work with Tomcat 4.0, but forgot to
        mention it here.

        * Added some more default InterWiki references (TWiki,
        MeatballWiki, Wikipedia).

2002-02-15  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * PageInfo and Edit now also include PageHeader.jsp.  Suggested by
        Kim Holviala.

        * v1.6.11-beta.

        * XML-RPC interface now supports a new method:
        getRPCVersionSupported(), which returns which version of API we
        support.  This is currently 1.

        * Fixed <TT> support: it is now actually possible to write
        multiple lines using {{ and }}, much like it is with '' and __.
        Suggested by Sesh Jalagam.

        * Rewrote table support.  The TranslatorReader engine is now a lot
        smarter about things than it used to be, and now it does not
        matter how you use the table marker, as long as it's the first
        character on the line.

2002-02-14  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * Bug fix: RCSFileProvider could hang in certain operations,
        especially with long revision histories.  A JUnit test was added
        for this.

2002-02-10  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.6.10-cvs

        * XML-RPC interface now hopefully gives out the modification time
        in UTC, before it used the local timezone.

2002-02-09  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * Unused and undefined pages are now sorted.  Suggested by Mikael
        Honkala.

        * Using the table directive now causes an explicit "BORDER=1" to
        be output to support older browsers.  Also, reworked some of the
        stylesheets so that IE and Konqueror at least look the same now.
        Mozilla is still having problems with THEAD stylesheets.

2002-02-06  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.6.9-cvs

        * Added support for tables.  Sanna VBÂŽdBÂŽdtBÂŽdinen finally managed to
        convince me to add them, by pointing out some real deficiences in
        the preformatted-text style tables =).

        * TextUtil.replaceString() would trash replacements of lengths of
        two or more.  Oops.

        * XML-RPC interface now goes around the UTF-8 problem by giving
        out Base64-encoded UTF-8 data as page data, and expects all page
        names to be strings encoded using URL encoding with UTF-8 text.
        This is regardless of the actual encoding used by the JSPWiki
        engine.

        * ReferringPagesPlugin now has extra parameter: "extras", which
        can be used to note how many pages are still left with references
        to this particular page.

        * Fixed a serious bug in CachingProvider, which caused null values
        to be added to the internal page collection.  Thanks to Mahlen
        Morris for pointing it out.

        * New class: InternalWikiException which gets thrown in case
        something really fishy and serious is going on inside Wiki.

2002-02-03  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * Fixed a slow routine in TranslatorReader, shaving off roughly
        10% of translation time.  Construction Exceptions is truly heavy.

2002-01-30  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.6.8-cvs

        * CachingProvider was iterating through the wrong collection.
        This might fix the NullPointerExceptions that have been coming
        around lately.

2002-01-28  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.6.7-cvs

        * Added new RPC API: getPageInfo( string page ), and getPageInfo(
        string page, int version ).  Also, the struct returned by
        getRecentChanges() and getPageInfo() got enhanced.

        * Wiki.jsp now shows the info on old versions properly: before it
        would show data pertaining to the current version, even if viewing
        an older version.

        * WikiPageProvider interface reworked slightly: Both getPageInfo()
        and getPageText() now need the version parameter.  Versionless
        methods are no longer supported (use LATEST_VERSION as a special
        tag for version to get the latest.)  I did this to simplify the
        API so that there would be less methods to implement.

        * RCSFileProvider can now fetch information on old pages
        correctly. 

2002-01-27  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.6.6-cvs.

        * Added XML-RPC call system.  See the com.ecyrd.jspwiki.xmlrpc
        package for more information.

        * Error output from RCS commands is now visible in the log.

        * Diff.jsp now has links to the actual page and the Page Info.

        * Some more refactoring inside WikiEngine: removed redundant
        code.

        * Refactored TranslatorReader to be more modular.  Provided hooks
        into the internals, so that links can now be read on-the-fly.

        * WikiEngine.getInstance() is now protected against multiple
        concurrent invocations.  This should help with startup issues.

2002-01-25  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * CachingProvider now provides some protection against
        concurrency, but it is known to fail at occasion.

        * Fixed a NullPointerException in Wiki.jsp, if the page did not
        exist.

        * Changed bottom line ordering in Wiki.jsp so that it takes less
        vertical screen space.

2002-01-20  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * SystemInfo.jsp page enhanced with new features.

        * v1.6.5-cvs

        * The WikiPageProvider interface has been enhanced with new
        methods.

        * CachingProvider reworked.  The getAllPages() now keeps its own
        cache, so that it can return the required pages without going
        through the actual provider.  This should speed things up a lot.
        A real solution is, however required.

2002-01-13  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * Added CachingProvider, inspired by Chris Brooking (though in a
        far simpler form).

        * v1.6.4-cvs.

        * RecentChanges list now displays author info.

        * All referral plugins (UnusedPages, UndefinedPages,
        ReferringPages) now recognize a "maxwidth" parameter, which can be
        used to limit the size of the written links.  This is very useful
        in the context of putting an automatic referral list to the
        LeftMenu, which might otherwise grow too wide.  The default
        LeftMenuFooter now reflects this.

        * Added the ability to modify the written link to the
        TranslatorReader by hooking in a StringTransmutator callback.

2002-01-10  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * PageModified.jsp wouldn't compile - I forgot to update the new
        location for TextUtil.replaceString().  Oops.

2002-01-09  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * SystemInfo.jsp now shows the used character encoding as well.

2002-01-07  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.6.3-beta.
        
        * Changed my email address.

        * Slightly changed ebu's hack to colorize diffs to work on all
        browsers, even those that are CSS-challenged.  Instead of
        DIV-tags and CSS-files, we now rely on tables.

        * Possibly fixed a problem with Win2k and RCS by rewriting the
        regular expression used to fetch the author name.  Thanks to Sesh
        Jalagam for the tip.

2002-01-06  Erik Bunn  <Erik.Bunn@nospam.memecry.net>

        * Fixed bug in referrals; when removing links to non-existant
        pages, unused pages no longer shows the removed link.

2001-12-13  Erik Bunn  <Erik.Bunn@nospam.memecry.net>

        * Initial hack to make diffs prettier implemented. Relies
        on CSS, uses lots of DIV tags, and the mac/ie css'es haven't
        been tested. 

2001-12-04  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * cssinclude.js now also sets some basic LINK elements: "start"
        refers to a page called "Main", "help" directs you to
        TextFormattingRules, and "search" takes you to Search.jsp.  The
        bad thing is that now the page names are pretty much fixed.

2001-12-03  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.6.2-cvs.

        * Wiki.jsp now has a direct link from the last change date to the
        latest change.

        * PageInfo.jsp can now display differences between a previous
        version and the current version.

        * Diff.jsp now handles requests for current version as well.

2001-12-01  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.6.1-cvs.

        * Removed last traces of JSP tags.

        * Changed plugin parameter marker to WHERE instead of WITH.

2001-11-25  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * Added new property: jspwiki.baseURL to define protection against
        URL rewriting gateways.  Requested by Kim Holviala.

        * Added the entire plugin system, making many JSP pages obsolete.
        New classes include PluginManager, taking care of the plugins.

        * Added com.ecyrd.jspwiki.plugin package with new plugin classes:
        RecentChangesPlugin, UnusedPagesPlugin, UndefinedPagesPlugin,
        ReferringPagesPlugin.

2001-11-23  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * Moved TranslatorReader.replaceString() to TextUtil, since it is
        a more logical place.

2001-11-23  Erik Bunn  <Erik.Bunn@nospam.memecry.net>

        * Added ReferenceManager and utilizing features. JSPWiki can
        now keep track of unused and undefined pages, and of pages 
        referring to a given page. Initial version, very unoptimized.
        See ReferenceManager.java and UnusedPages.jsp.

2001-11-20  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * Now replaces HTML entities correctly also in getText().  Thanks
        to Kim Holviala for pointing this one out.

        * This is release v1.6.0.

        * Quotes in HTML text is now escaped using &quot;

2001-11-18  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.5.8.

        * Fixed problem with UTF-8 decoding trashing a variable.  Thanks
        to Chris Brooking.

        * Searching in UTF-8 files now works.

2001-11-14  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * TranslatorReader now takes a Reader instead of BufferedReader.

        * Reworked some of the internals of WikiEngine and
        TranslatorReader, making them easier to read.

        * v1.5.7-beta.

        * Incorporated fix from Chris Brooking for the URL encoding, a
        workaround for JDK bug #4257115.

2001-11-11  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.5.6

        * Added NDC for all major JSP pages to make them simpler to
        debug. 

        * All pages now also export the META Content-Type information to
        support older browsers.

        * Possibly fixed a problem with readContents() throwing an
        IOException: "invalid mark" by increasing buffer size.

        * RCS commands now inherit the parent environment.  This might
        help with some Windows-related issues.

2001-11-08  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * Prevent robots from caching Edit, Diff, PageInfo and
        PageModified - not much point in caching those, really.

        * v1.5.5-beta.

        * Bug fix: Starting a new page no longer results as 'null' as the
        initial text.  Oops.

2001-11-07  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.5.4

        * Now FileSystemProvider and RCSFileProvider default back to
        ISO-8859-1 if the data is obviously not UTF-8.  This makes
        upgrading much easier.

        * Oops, diff forgot to use the chosen character encoding, and
        would assume ISO-8859-1.

2001-11-06  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.5.3

        * Bug fix: the RCSFileProvider used UTC instead of local time.
        Now fixed.  If you've changed the logcommands in
        jspwiki.properties, check the new format, or you'll be burned.

        * JSPWiki can now handle also non-ISO-8859-1 charsets.  Check
        README for more info.  Thanks to  Chris Brooking for the initial
        code.  This is a heavy-duty change - most of the JSP pages were
        affected, since they need to decode the page names in a new way.

        * v1.5.2

        * For browsers that do not support CSS, Wiki.jsp now also uses
        explicit FONT when displaying version information.

        * Empty list items could cause crashes in parsing.  Now fixed,
        thanks to Mikael Honkala for reporting this.

        * Oops, it was possible to put Javascript inside external or image
        links.  Now fixed - all quotes inside link names are URLEncoded.

2001-11-04  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>
        
        * v1.5.1
        
        * Added WikiEngine.saveText( String, String, HttpServletRequest )
        so that it can get the author information from the request.  The
        old API is still supported.

        * WikiPageProvider interface changed: putPageText() now takes a
        WikiPage as an extra argument.

        * RCSFileProvider can now save and retrieve author info as well.

        * Anchor types (i.e. hyperlinks) now have classes so that you can
        redecorate them in the CSS files.  See the CSS files for more
        info.

        * DTD caused Mozilla to slip into standards-compliant mode.  Fixed
        top-margins in jspwiki_ie.css.

        * Added document type declarations to all JSP files.

2001-11-02  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * This is R3, v1.5.0

        * Rewrote README.

        * The distribution archive now contains a separate archive for all
        sample wiki pages to help you bootstrap your own Wiki.

        * Added JSPWikiTips page to the sample wiki pages collection.

        * Removed the authentication scheme from web.xml - out-of-box
        JSPWiki now allows access to anyone.

        * Default, out-of-the-box Page Provider is now
        FileSystemProvider.  This should make building your first Wiki a
        bit simpler.

        * Added file commands to jspwiki.properties.  Also, removed
        references to my own email address - I kept getting plenty of
        automatic email from people trying to set up their own Wiki :-).

        * Removed index.html and rewrote web.xml to automatically grab all
        directory accesses to Wiki.jsp.

        * We now use pageContext.forward() to go to the PageModified.jsp
        when a concurrent modification occurs, instead of using redirect.
        Thanks to Chris Brooking for this hint.

        * Slight cosmetical changes in jspwiki_ns.css

        * Added comments around Javascript code in cssinclude.js to better
        live with old browsers.

2001-11-01  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * Bumped version to 1.4.3-cvs.

        * There is now a sample entry in jspwiki.properties demonstrating
        how to make a direct link to the page editor by using InterWiki
        linking.  [Edit:Main] redirects you to the page where you can edit
        the Main page.

        * LeftMenu.jsp now reads its contents dynamically from a Wiki page
        called "LeftMenu".  Thanks to Mikael Honkala for this idea.

2001-10-30  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * Bumped version to 1.4.2-cvs.

        * Wiki.jsp changed with respect to handling of old page versions.
        It no longer displays the "edit current version".

        * TextFormattingRules now has plenty of more explanations.

        * Added support for arbitrary letters in WikiNames.  Now it's
        possible to use any character set.

        * Added support for links within a document ("footnotes").  Use
        [#1] to create a footnote and [1] to link to it.

        * Empty links no longer generate a hyperlink.

        * FileSystemProvider and RCSFileProvider now know how to handle
        WikiNames that contain illegal characters.  At the moment they use
        simply the java.net.URLEncoder class to make the conversion.

        * Added wrap="virtual" to Edit.jsp textarea element to make it
        also wrap on NS4.

2001-10-25  Erik Bunn  <Erik.Bunn@nospam.memecry.net>

        * Added the capability to view older versions of a WikiPage. 
        The functionality is accessed from PageInfo.jsp. Wiki.jsp
        is affected, as well, and WikiEngine.java has new methods
        (but no actual new functionality).        

2001-10-21  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * This is R2 - v1.4.0.

        * Rewrote the included sample pages.

2001-10-20  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * build.xml can now generate javadocs to docs/javadoc.

        * Edit.jsp now has explains headings, too (thanks Matti).

        * Changed the versioning so that whenever you check out a CVS
        copy, you get vX.Y.Z-cvs as the version string.  This was done to
        separate the development version from the actual release version.

        * Added the list of image inline link patterns to SystemInfo.jsp.

2001-10-18  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.3.3 - not released.

        * You can now have multiline list items if you prepend each
        additional line with a space.

        * Added the ability to specify multiple patterns determining which
        images are inlined and which are not.  See jspwiki.properties for
        more information.

2001-10-16  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * All external links ending with .png are now inlined as images.
        This is an experiment to see if it actually works.  Don't expect
        it to last.

        * Page names can now contain _ and . as well.

        * Added some cosmetical changes to the JSP pages.

2001-10-06  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * Release v1.3.1 - first official release.

        * Clarified build system.

        * All files should now contain copyright.

        * Added plenty of javadoc commentary.

2001-10-02  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * Bold and italic information is now carried across line and
        paragraph breaks.

2001-09-30  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * Added cssinclude.js and three browser-dependent stylesheet
        files.  Also, all jsp files now include the cssinclude.js.

2001-08-25  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * Removed a debug statement, some cosmetical changes.

        * v1.3.0

        * Added jspwiki.applicationName property, and support into
        WikiEngine.

        * Added SystemInfo.jsp

        * Added interWiki functionality.  Now you can define links in
        'jspwiki.properties' where a link of the form [WikiXX:PageName]
        should point to.

2001-08-13  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.2.0

        * WikiEngine now behaves much better if a provider cannot be
        instantiated.

        * Added rudimentary support for version history in a multitude of
        places.

2001-08-13  Janne Jalkanen  <jalkanen@nospam.kosh.ecyrd.com>

        * Wiki.jsp displayed null date if page did not exist.

2001-07-23  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.1.2

        * Search engine interface is now cleaner.

        * Separated actual Wiki page serving from the WikiEngine and hid
        it under the WikiPageProvider interface.

2001-07-20  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * Realm name is now "JSPWiki editor" instead of "Basic
        Authentication Area" or whatever stupid it was.

2001-07-19  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * Conversion of {{ is now fixed - it no longer transforms {{{ into
        {<TT> in certain cases.  Also, multiple {{{s are now handled
        gracefully.

        * v1.1.1

2001-07-18  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * Added a Search box to the header of each page.

        * HTML entities are now replaced correctly in PageModified.jsp to
        prevent arbitrary HTML tags.

        * Added support for <TT> tag with {{text}}.

2001-07-16  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * Couldn't edit new pages, oops.

2001-07-15    <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.regex.fi>

        * Added rudimentary page locking.

2001-07-14  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * Appearance of the jsp pages is now slightly more convergent.

        * Improved search engine to accept exclusion/inclusion a la
        Google.  Scoring now works, too.

        * Added ordered lists (#).

        * Horizontal ruler is now four dashes instead of three to comply
        with the Wiki standard.

2001-07-13  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * Added jspwiki.specialPage.XXX redirection.  You can now name
        special pages that get referred to whichever JSP page you want.
        For example, you can always refer to RecentChanges.jsp in your
        Wiki code by using [RecentChanges], with the following property
        set: 
        
        jspwiki.specialPage.RecentChanges = RecentChanges.jsp

        * v1.0.5

2001-07-10  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * Removed SkipHTMLIterator because it was a bad idea.  No
        InterCapped hyperlinks are available.

        * Fixed tests so that they now actually run.  This required a new
        constructor for WikiEngine.

2001-07-09  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * TranslatorWriter.cleanLink() now removes all non-letters and
