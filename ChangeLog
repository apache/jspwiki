2004-11-14  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * v2.1.120

        * Added the WikiForms system in the CVS.  It has been slightly
        changed from the WikiForms as submitted by ebu.  Documentation
        to follow (it'll be faster if someone volunteers it :).

        * It's now possible to use SET to copy variables.
        [{SET var1='{$var2}'}].  Suggested by Reinhard Engel.

2004-11-09  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * v2.1.119

        * Now should compile on JDK 1.5.  Thanks to Dan Johnson.

2004-11-06  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * v2.1.118

        * Improved attachment error handling (check UploadTemplate.jsp)

        * It is now possible to limit the size of the attachments that
        are uploaded by using the "jspwiki.attachments.maxsize" property.

        * The attachment servlet now uses the workdir to put temporary
        files in instead of the java.io.tmpdir.  This is to facilitate
        some ISPs which do not allow you to access a temporary directory.
        Thanks to Mike Lippold.

        * Removed extra parameters from jspwiki.tld - I thought I had done
        it so I ignored bug reports about this.  Oops.  Sorry.  *sheepish
        grin*.

2004-11-02  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * v2.1.117

        * Patch from Paul Wagland to fix issues with Lucene and
        CachingProvider (it would not notice external modifications of pages).
        Thanks!

2004-10-28  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * v2.1.116

        * Added patch to fix WikiDatabase initialization problems.
        Thanks to Steffen Stundzig!

        * XMLRPC and InsertPage now also check for page permissions.
        Since there is no way to do XML-RPC user auth (at the
        moment), XML-RPC always assumes the user is a "Guest".

2004-10-14  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * v2.1.115

        * NamedGroup now works.  Some refactoring of Login.jsp to make
        it more usable.

2004-10-12  Erik Bunn  <Erik.Bunn@memecry.net>

        * v2.1.114
        
        * Refactoring: added getInstance(ServletConfig,Properties)
        to provide WikiEngine with external property set. Useful 
        mainly in administration of multiple webapps that use 
        JSPWiki.

2004-10-10  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * v2.1.113

        * Bug fix: 304 check in AttachmentServlet was wrong.  Reported by 
        Yogesh Patel.

2004-10-09  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * v2.1.112

        * Developers be aware: FilterManager now throws a lot more
        exceptions...  So does WikiEngine.saveText().

        * VariableManager now also outputs variables from the HTTP
        Session and the Servlet Request Parameters (assuming they are
        Strings.)

        * VariableManager has now a new variable: $pagefilters, which
        lists all the filters currently in use.

        * Added FilterException and RedirectException.  Filters can now
        throw a RedirectException upon preSave() and postSave() to change
        the place to which the user is redirected after an edit.  Also
        changed the PageFilter interface to match.

        * Added SpamFilter

2004-09-25  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * v2.1.111

        * Added TableOfContents plugin.

        * Now recognizes all official IANA URI types correctly as
        external links.

2004-09-24  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * v2.1.110

        * Added the JSPWiki logo to the default distribution.

        * Reworked the default template a bit - there were some brainfarts
        in it, causing it to fail on more picky browsers like Safari.

        * ReferenceManager serialization is now slightly faster.

2004-09-19  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.1.109

        * RCSFileProvider now sets the sizes when asked for page history,
        making it a lot faster.

        * Moved get/setSize() to WikiPage.

        * v2.1.108

        * CachingProvider now also caches page history.  This helps the
        history generation from the really slow providers like
        RCSProvider.

        * ReferenceManager now serializes its status on disk at every
        save, and returns it at startup.  This provides *significant*
        speedup at JSPWiki start.

2004-08-30  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * v2.1.107

        * Oof... Apparently java.net.URLEncoder *does* use the default
        platform encoding.  Fixed it to use either UTF-8 or ISO-8859-1 to
        make all scandic tests also run on OSX (which defaults to Mac
        Roman, duh).  Also fixed the tests so that they are now full
        US-ASCII instead of Latin-1.

2004-08-05  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * v2.1.106.

        * Added documentation for WeblogPlugin and WeblogEntryPlugin.

        * PluginTag now also accepts body content, which gets translated
        to the "_body" content of the plugin.  Thanks to Foster Schucker
        for the initial code.

2004-08-03  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * v2.1.105

        * Added Killer's patch for BasicAttachmentProvider - it now
        actually deletes attachments.

2004-07-16  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.1.104

        * DefaultPermissions now has a variable: "defaultpermissions",
        which is used to read the permissions in.  The permissions of the
        actual page "DefaultPermissions", and the actual default
        permissions are now thus separate.  See the DefaultPermissions
        page in the distribution for more information.

        * Added set/getLoginName() to UserProfile.

        * Added documentation for the three new tags.

2004-06-27  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * v2.1.103

        * Major additions to FindContent.jsp - got rid of most of the
        scriptlets.  Added three new tags to the soup as well, so you
        can now write around your searchstuff with those.  It is remotely
        possible that old search code breaks now.

        * v2.1.102

        * Added ebu's patch against NPEs in UserManager.

2004-06-13  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * v2.1.101

        * Added "debug" parameter to all plugins.  This is recognized by
        the JSPWiki engine itself, and if the parameter is specified as
        "true", JSPWiki will automatically output all parameters and the
        stack trace to the page itself, if there is an exception.
        Suggested by Foster Schucker.

2004-06-10  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.1.100
        
        * All WikiProviders now take WikiEngine as one of the arguments to
        the constructor.  I'm sorry, but this does break all 3rd party
        providers... The change is really simple, though; and for good
        reason.

        * Added new property: jspwiki.workDir.  This is used in the future
        for all kinds of caching and other events.  At the moment, only
        Lucene uses it.

        * Included Mahlen Morris' patch for Apache Lucene -enabled search.
        It's FAAAST.  Thanks!

        * Bug fix: Direct URIs in text would cause a failure, if they
        contained wikimarkup.

2004-06-03  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * Corrected DTD URI in web.xml.  Thanks to Lance Bader.

2004-06-03  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * v2.1.99.

        * Fixed a long-standing problem with hyperlinks inside headers
        causing strange behaviour with generated section names.  Reported
        by Foster Schucker.

2004-05-16  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * v2.1.98.

        * Removed all HTML generation from TranslatorReader into
        HTMLRenderer, and added TextRenderer.

2004-05-14  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.1.97.

        * Added preliminary support for the Atom blog API.  It still does
        not yet completely work, however.

2004-05-13  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * Denounce plugin no longer fails on null user-agent.

        * v2.1.96.

        * Added new FeedDiscoveryTag, deprecated RSSLinkTag.

        * Added atom.jsp to support the 0.3 version of Atom.  The Atom
        feed attempts to figure out the blog name from a page variable
        called "blogname".

2004-05-03  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * v2.1.95.

        * Implemented rest of the MetaWeblogAPI routines.  They are
        completely untested yet.

2004-04-09  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.1.94.

        * Now default template links to jspwiki.org EditPageHelp in case
        the page is missing.  Suggested by SebastianPetzelberger.

2004-03-31  Erik Bunn  <ebu@spamicide.basen.net>

        * v2.1.93
        
        * Modified UserManager, UserDatabase, WikiDatabase: UserProfile
        objects are now ultimately produced by the UserDatabase implementation.
        By plugging in a different implementation, you can e.g. construct users
        from a database.

2004-01-21  Erik Bunn  <ebu@spamicide.basen.net>

	* v2.1.92

	* Modified all IteratorTag classes to use WikiContext.clone()
	instead of creating a new one. This preserves the context info.

2004-01-15  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.1.91.

        * Plugin errors are now logged as INFO level for convinience.
        Getting a zillion emails every time someone mistypes a plugin name
        is NOT good.

2004-01-13  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.1.90.

2004-01-12  Erik Bunn  <ebu@spamicide.basen.net>

	* Added UserManager.getUserDatabase(), getAuthenticator().
	These are useful for external user providers.

	* Added WikiGroup.clearMembers(). 

2003-12-04  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.1.89.

        * Made WikiDatabase.initDataBase() and WikiDatabase.updateGroup()
        protected at Killer's request. 

2003-11-22  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.1.88.

        * Implemented a completely new PageFilter initialization
        system. Please see the new PageFilters page in the documentation.
        NB: The Filter interface did not change, but any setup
        instructions did.

2003-11-07  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.1.87.

        * Changed the default template to have a better structure w/
        respect to the cssinclude.js script.

2003-11-06  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.1.86.

        * Added the "section" parameter to InsertPage plugin.  Requested
        by John Volkar.

2003-10-20  Erik Bunn  <ebu@spamicide.basen.net>

        * v2.1.85
        
        * Added CreatePermission, and support for it in WikiPermission,
        Edit.jsp.

        * Modified Login.jsp functionality slightly, to support a 'msg'
        context variable for displaying a friendly message. (This could
        be changed to include a WikiPage, perhaps.)

2003-10-19  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.1.84.

        * Removed the unused "comment" parameter from Edit.jsp, since we
        now have the "Comment.jsp" for that kind of stuff.

        * Saving from preview page works now.  Also, added a link for
        "keep editing" and "cancel" so that it's more user-friendly now.
        Note that they the content preview "Save" is a CSS hack, and the
        content preview "Keep editing" is a Javascript hack, so they might
        not always work.  The modifications required only changes to the
        "default" template, so anyone who has their own template needs to
        check out how it's done.

        * v2.1.83.

        * All plugins use now log4j Logger instead of Category.

        * Added WeblogArchivePlugin.

2003-10-15  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.1.82.

        * Tentative changes in CachingProvider to solve the "externally
        modified repository"-problem.

        * v2.1.81.

        * Some tiny refactoring of the TranslatorReader; also enhanced
        WikiEngine javadocs a bit.

        * Small fix to deal with named anchor links (they accidentally
        encoded the '#' as well.) 

2003-10-14  Erik Bunn <ebu at iki dot fi>

        * v2.1.80
	 	
        * Modified VariableManager and VariableTag: they now search for
        page metadata after everything else fails. Using the [{SET
        foo="bar"}] syntax on a WikiPage, you can examine the variable
        with [{$foo}] on the page, or using the Variable tag in your
        templates.

2003-10-13  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.1.79.

        * Incorporated multiply nested list patch from MurrayG.  Thanks!

2003-10-10  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.1.78.

        * Headings now generate a named anchor.  This enables things like
        page contents.  The current scheme is
        '#section-<pagename>-<heading>', where both the <pagename> and
        <heading> are WikiNames.  The WikiName of the heading is done in
        exactly the same way as with normal WikiPages.  For more
        information, see NamedHeadings in the jspwiki_samplepages.zip.
        Suggested by Paul Downes.

2003-10-10   Erik Bunn <ebu at iki dot fi>

        * v2.1.77

        * Modified CachingProvider to notify engine of external changes
        to wikipages. Fixed tests; external modification tests should now
        work.

2003-10-06  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.1.76.

        * Implemented deleteVersion() for VersioningFileProvider.
        However, there's still a critical bug in it.

        * Added built-in properties so that certain settings can also be
        fetched internally.

        * Added "redirect" capacity: Any page can contain now a 
        [{SET redirect=http://foo.bar.com}] and automatically be
        redirected to anywhere.  This essentially duplicates the
        functionality of "jspwiki.specialPage" -setting, but in an
        user-controllable manner.

        * Added "alias" capacity: you can now put a [{SET alias=PageName}]
        on a page and it will be redirected on view to some other page.

2003-10-01  Erik Bunn  <ebu at iki dot fi>

        * Modified WikiDatabase: removed hard-coding of 'members' attr name,
        fixed _members to members.
        
        * Modified AuthorizationManager: jspwiki.authorizer property no longer
        required, uses PageAuthorizer by default.
        
        * Moved PageAuthorizer to com.ecyrd.jspwiki.auth.modules.

2003-10-01  Erik Bunn  <ebu at iki dot fi>

        * v2.1.75

        * Modified order of UserManager and ReferenceManager
        init in WikiEngine.initialize(). This was relevant to
        custom manager implementations.

        * Modified AuthorizationManager to look for property
        jspwiki.authorizer and load a WikiAuthorizer dynamically.

2003-09-29  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.1.74.

        * Bug fix: RCSFileProvider would erroneusly report fetching as
        failed in certain rare conditions.

        * ReferenceManager now keeps its lists sorted.  This has the
        effect of having backlink lists (referred-by), Unreferenced pages,
        etc.  sorted as well.  Requested by John Volkar.

        * Fixed problem with plain style URIs not being terminated at
        EOL.

2003-09-28  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.1.73.

        * RCSFileProvider and FileSystemProvider now support page
        deletion.  The top-level management interface is still missing,
        though.

2003-09-27  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.1.72.

        * Added TemplateManager.

        * Administrators now need to be authenticated (duh).

        * Fixed group formation; it is still a bit clunky but it works now.

2003-09-22  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * ant javadoc now creates usage information as well.

2003-09-18  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.1.71.

        * Oops, using container-based authentication got you in wrong
        groups. Fixed.

        * Added permission checking for attachments as well.  New
        permission called "upload".

        * Attachment image URL now uses baseURL.  Reported by Niilo Neuvo.

2003-09-14  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.1.70.

        * Added variable "requestcontext".  Requested by Francois Parlant.

        * Slight changes to auth code; authentication via cookie no longer
        considered trustworthy =). 

        * Fixed some failing auth tests.

        * v2.1.69.

        * Hopefully finally fixed problems with RefMgr and english
        plurals. 

2003-09-09  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.1.68.

        * Added the print stylesheet from Philip van Bogaert to the
        default template.

2003-09-07  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.1.67.

        * Fixed also a couple of ReferenceManager bugs relating to plural
        page names.  However, a couple of small problems still remain.

        * BasicAttachmentProvider no longer fails if there are extraneous
        directories in the attachment repository.  Reported by someone
        whom I can't recall...

        * Fixed a bunch of failing tests to conform with the actual code
        base.

        * v2.1.66.

        * WeblogPlugin now displays all entries, if parameter "days" is
        set to "all".

2003-09-04  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.1.65.

        * WeblogPlugin now beautifies the entry author name.

2003-09-02  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.1.64.

        * Added two new variables: $attachmentProvider and
        $attachmentProviderDescription to match the pageprovider ones.
        
        * Fixed problem with AclImpl returning late - if we use implies()
        we must return at the first matching check.

        * Added CachingAttachmentProvider.  It is activated by setting the
        jspwiki.usePageCache property, the same as with CachingProvider.
        Suggested by Niilo Neuvo.

2003-09-01  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.1.63.

        * CachingProvider now makes an educated guess about page
        existence, which should speed things up quite a lot on systems
        that have slower providers.  Suggested by Niilo Neuvo.

2003-08-31  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.1.62.

        * rss.jsp now supports OSCache.

2003-08-29  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.1.61.

        * AttachmentServlet now checks the If-Modified-Since -header from
        the browser, and returns a 304 (HTTP_NOT_MODIFIED) if the
        attachment has not been modified.  Contributed by Aiko Mastboom.

2003-08-26  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.1.60.

        * Enabled <rtexprvalue> for all Calendar attributes.  Requested by

        * v2.1.59.

        * Added the concept of an administrator.  Code exists, but is
        still subject to bugs in the group code.  Use
        "jspwiki.auth.administrator" to set the group/username who is the
        administrator; default is "AdminGroup".

        * v2.1.58.

        * InsertPage plugin now supports "class" parameter.

        * WeblogPlugin now also supports the "page" parameter.

2003-08-24  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.1.57.

        * Error.jsp now shows the root cause instead of the JspException.
        This should make the error messages a bit more comprehensible
        without dipping into the log files.

        * PermissionTag was amended to work with the new permission
        system. 

        * Added Delete.jsp and added preliminary support to page removal.
        Doesn't work yet, though.

        * CachingProvider now bypasses its own search method, if the
        provider implements the FastSearch interface.  This interface
        defines no methods.  Those providers where searching can be done
        very efficiently should benefit a lot from this. Requested by
        Sulka Haro.

2003-08-19  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.1.56.

        * Fixed a problem where special pages (Search.jsp,
        UserPreferences.jsp) had always "Main" as their title.
        Incidentally, the solution also allows you to localize the search
        and preferences page names.  See jspwiki.properties for more
        information.  Reported by Niilo Neuvo.

        * v2.1.55.

        * ReferenceManager is now a PageFilter.

2003-08-13  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.1.54.

        * Fixed (hopefully) problem with IE 5.22 on OSX, which would
        upload a file with 0x0D0A added to the front of the filename.
        Reported by Xiaan.
        
2003-07-17  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.1.53.

        * Added VotePlugin as an experiment.  Don't use it for anything
        real. 

2003-07-15  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.1.52
        
        * Integrated the OSCache from OpenSymphony group.  Currently the
        only one that uses it is the CachingProvider, but I'd expect to do
        more soon.

2003-07-08  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.1.51.

        * WebLogPlugin now attempts to guess the number of comments on the
        comment page, and displays them with the "Comments?" text.  It
        also appends the number of comments to the URL, so that the user's
        browser would show that the link contents have changed since last
        visit. 

2003-07-07  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.1.50.

        * InsertPageTag now only calls pageExists() OR getPage(),
        depending on the situation.  This should speed up performance a
        bit.  Reported by Mark Griffith.

        * Bug fix: Comment.jsp would transform HTML entities one time too
        many :-).

2003-07-06  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.1.49.

        * PageTypeTag now recognizes also weblog entries.

        * v2.1.48.

        * It is now possible to set the cache consistency checks for
        CachingProvider. 

        * v2.1.47.

        * It is now possible to set the "remember" -flag to Comment.jsp,
        who will then write the author info to a cookie.  The default
        template shows you how.

2003-07-05  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.1.46.

        * Added comment functionality and CommentLinkTag.

        * WeblogPlugin now generates a separate <div> around the entry
        itself.  This should make it a bit easier to create your own
        layouts.  Note that the CSS class names were also changed - check
        out the default template jspwiki.css to see the new names!  (I am
        bravely changing them because I assume nobody else is using
        JSPWiki for blogging =).  Comments now also open in a separate
        frame.

        * Split the default EditTemplate into two parts: EditContent and
        CommentContent, since they're slightly different.  You might want
        to take a look at it, since you might want to take some ideas into
        your own template.

        * Rewrote parts of the access control system - each permission now
        has to implement implies().

        * Added CommentPermission.

        * v2.1.45.

        * Added some new search engines to Denounce.

        * Upgraded to log4j 1.2.8, even though it is about twice the size
        of 1.1.3.  This should make life easier to people who are doing
        embedding work, for example.  Transition from Category to Logger
        is happening...

2003-07-03  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * Changed default "has this page been changed" -check interval in
        CachingProvider to 30 seconds, because there were some issues in
        high-load situations when using a shorter interval.  Also removed
        some non-functional code.

2003-07-02  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.1.44.

        * Added rest of usergroup support.  Whee!

2003-06-27  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.1.43.

        * Rudimentary group support added for the three constant groups:
        All, Named and Known.  Others should work, too, but currently
        there is no proper way to add groups.

2003-06-26  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.1.42.

        * Added patch to list attachments too when asking for links using
        the listLinks() method for XML-RPC.  Patch kindly donated by
        Christopher Lenz.

2003-06-24  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.1.41.

        * Now parses hyperlinks correctly if you have enabled CamelCase.

2003-06-23  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.1.40.

        * Added Denounce plugin.

2003-06-14  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.1.39.

        * Added maxEntries parameter to the WeblogPlugin.

        * Author name is now shown with the blog entry.

        * Bug fix: we didn't set the author on edit, but used the previous
        author.  Oops =).

2003-06-10  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.1.38.

        * Added %%-commands for styles.  %%classname will use the given
        class as defined in the CSS file; %%( CSS-data ) will use the
        given CSS style.

        * v2.1.37.

        * Added "template" -parameter to LinkToTag, so you can now
        generate links directly using a template.

        * Added InsertPage plugin from Scott Hurlbert.  Thanks, Scott!

2003-06-09  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.1.36.

        * Added parameter "entrytext" to WeblogEntryPlugin.

        * Added "NewBlogEntry.jsp", since on a multi-user weblog you would
        very easily get conflicts with people editing the same page.
        Also, if you had an old version in the cache, clicking on "New
        entry" would cause the entry to go to an old date.

2003-06-07  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.1.35.

        * If CamelCase links have been set on, then straight URLs are now
        linked, too.  This makes JSPWiki behaviour similar to all other
        WikiEngines that support traditional linking.

2003-06-05  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.1.34.

        * It is now possible to define the location of the
        jspwiki.properties file through a servlet init parameter.  See
        samplepages.zip and the page "MultipleWikis".

2003-06-04  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.1.33.

        * The property file was not closed after it was opened.  This
        tended to cause some problems with WebLogic.  Reported by Mark
        Griffith. 

2003-06-03  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.1.32.

        * Moved around some tests in their proper places.

        * Changed the build system somewhat: There is now a
        "build.properties" -file which allows you to customize the
        compilation somewhat.  This should help those that are developing
        on Windows-based systems, since paths can now be set up correctly
        automatically.  As an example, I've included a
        build.properties.win for Windows-machines, and build.properties
        for non-Windows machines.  Suggested by originally by someone
        whose name I can't recall, and I seem to have lost the mail :-/.

        * v2.1.31.

        * Added "exists" -attribute back to UserCheckTag, since it seems
        pointless to break down perfectly good templates.  However, it's
        use is strongly deprecated, and it is converted on-the-fly to an
        equivalent "status" -attribute.

        * Moved all default template CSS definitions to jspwiki.css, as
        per the example in the mrg template.  However, the
        browser-specific files have been kept as well. Duh.  In retrospect
        it is obvious that you can have more than one stylesheet file defined
        per page. :-)

2003-06-01  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.1.30.

        * CalendarTag enhanced: You can now use monthurlformat parameter
        to determine where the month-text should go to.  Use "%d" within
        this instance to get the month length.

        * CalendarTag enhanced: You can now use "%p" to signify the
        current page name in any of the parameters.

        * v2.1.29.

        * Added to WikiAuthenticator interface: It is now theoretically
        possible to change passwords as well (though there is no
        support within JSP for that).

        * UserManager now handles logins/logouts properly.  We now have
        fully functional login/logout functionality!

        * Creating a WikiContext with WikiEngine.createContext() now
        actually throws an exception if it sees that WikiEngine has not
        been configured correctly.  This hopefully removes a bunch of
        NullPointerExceptions and other nasties that occurred when the
        jspwiki.properties file was not correct.
        
        Unfortunately the error messages are still not very informative,
        but as long as we create the WikiEngine in the jspInit(), then we
        have to do it like this...  Any exceptions thrown there get
        ignored by Tomcat.

        * Deprecated away a bunch of methods from WikiEngine, most notably
        saveText( String, String ).  Also, findWikiClass() is gone (moved
        to ClassUtil).

        * VariableManager now recognizes two new variables (or constants,
        depends on your point of view): "username" and "loginstatus".

        * Added new PriorityList class.

        * Added new "util" -package.

        * Added ClassUtil class so that it is easier to handle class
        information.  Among other things, this replaces
        WikiEngine.findWikiClass().

        * UserCheckTag modified: It now has a parameter "status" instead
        of the old "exists", and it has been considerably enhanced in
        use.  The old "exists=true" is now replaced with "status=known",
        and "exists=false" is "status=unknown".  There are also other
        options available.

        * v2.1.28.

        * Mental note: when you say "cvs commit", see which directory
        you're in.

        * There is now a general saving/loading filtering
        functionality. See the new "filters" package.  It does not still
        have all of the usability that would be nice, but it should be
        ready for testing.

2003-05-31  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.1.27.

        * UserManager was slightly confused about what kind of
        authentication is preferable over what.  Fixed now so that if you
        have done container-based authentication, you will actually be
        logged in with proper username =).

        * v2.1.26.

        * Added Release.getVersionString() for those who are annoyed at
        having to recompile their JSP pages each time they install a new
        version (like me).

        * Made the default templates a bit more XHTML compliant.  There
        are still some oddities left, though.

        * "{{{ }}}" now emit <span style="..."> when inlined.  This allows
        you to write inlined code that does not do any translation.
        Thanks to Lars Schmidt-Thieme.

        * Paragraph generation (the infamous <p> -tag) is now XHTML
        compatible.

        * A bunch of XHTML changes, thanks to an extremely high-quality
        patch from Lars Schmidt-Thieme.  A lot of the plugins and tags now
        work better.

        * v2.1.25.

        * CachingProvider now caches saved page modification dates
        correctly. 

        * CachingProvider can now also detect deleted pages, and signals
        PageManager correctly in this case.

2003-05-29  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.1.24.

        * CheckLockTag would sometimes throw a NullPointerException.
        Reported by Romeo Disca. 

2003-05-26  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.1.23.

        * out.png is now correctly transparent, thanks to Paul Downes.

        * CachingProvider can now detect if the page has been modified
        externally.

        * rss.jsp is now a part of the main distribution.  It is however,
        very weblog-specific right now, and shares a bit too much code
        with the RSSGenerator.

        * RSS generator now outputs the diffs as well, so you can see what
        actually changed and what did not.

2003-05-22  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.1.22.

        * RSS generator now also displays whether the file that was
        changed was a wikipage or an attachment.

        * Fixed attachment URL generation: RSSGenerator would generate
        faulty URLs, and practically no routine did URL encoding.  Oops.
        Reported by Stefan Riss. 

2003-05-20  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.1.21.

        * Preview.jsp didn't compile, oops.

        * FileSystemProvider now stores author information as well.  This
        addresses the most-often heard FAQ: "Why is the author information
        not shown?".  To do this and not interfere with RCSFileProvider
        and VersioningFileProvider, I created a new class,
        AbstractFileProvider which stores no metadata, but all file-based
        providers now extend from it.

2003-05-19  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.1.20.

        * As an example, it is now possible to determine the template on a
        per-page basis by setting something like this on the page:
        
        [{SET jspwiki.templateDir=myTemplate}]
        
        However, at the moment the existence of the template directory is
        not checked, so it is possible to refer to templates that do not
        exist and get an empty page in return.

        Also CamelCase expansion can now be turned off on a page-by-page
        basis.
        
        * TranslatorReader now understands the SET directive.  It is thus
        now possible to set arbitrary attributes for pages which get
        stored in the WikiPage.

2003-05-18  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.1.19.

        * PageManager is now better protected against null page names.

        * Mass commit of authorization code.

2003-05-13  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.1.18.

        * WeblogPlugin should be now quite a lot faster determining which
        pages are blog entries.  I had to do this because my own weblog
        was getting unbearably slow.

        * v2.1.17.

        * Oops, wikiContext was accidentally changed to pageContext in
        Edit.jsp.  Reported by Erik Bunn. 

2003-05-11  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.1.16.

        * Added TemplateDir tag, so that templates can now figure out
        which template they belong to. 

2003-05-09  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.1.15.

        * Reduced common code in main JSP files by combining the most
        commonly used methods into WikiEngine.createContext().

2003-05-08  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.1.14.

        * Added the search_highlight script as suggested by Santiago
        Gala.  After a search when you go to a page, you will see all of
        the search terms highlighted, as defined in the CSS file.  If you
        have your own template, add the following to the ViewTemplate.jsp
        file: 
        
        <script src="templates/default/search_highlight.js"
        type="text/javascript"></script>
        
        And do not forget to copy the search_highlight.js file to your
        template.

2003-05-07  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.1.13.

        * RCSFileProvider no longer relies on garbage collection to close
        Process streams.  This may have some effect on the "leaking file
        handles" problem on Linux.  Testing...

2003-04-16  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.1.12.

        * Now JSP pages are protected against empty page names.

2003-04-13  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.1.11.

        * Checked a huge amount of authorization code, mostly reworked
        from JSPWIKI_AUTH_BRANCH.  Still missing: authenticators (that is,
        things interface with UserManager and manage passwords) and some
        fine-grainedness in handling things.

        * Error.jsp is now a lot more verbose about the kind of errors it
        finds. 

        * v2.1.10.

        * A mass import of the more stable parts of the new authentication
        system.  Most notably, there are now new packages for access
        control lists (com.ecyrd.jspwiki.acl) and permissions.  However,
        note that mostly everything does NOT work now - even tests don't
        compile because of some missing files.

2003-04-12  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * A few fixes to default template to be more XHTML compliant.

        * v2.1.9.

        * CachingProvider now also provides information on how many pages
        are currently in cache and how big they are.

        * TranslatorReader now outputs all tags in lowercase to be
        XHTML-compliant. 

2003-04-11  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.1.8.

        * CheckLockTag was a bit inconsistent: if the page was locked by
        the current user, it would of course always be "locked".  This
        means that the value of "unlocked" was essentially useless for
        Edit pages.  I added a new value for "mode": "owned".  Reported by
        Rajesh Raheja.

2003-04-10  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.1.7.

        * Added preliminary support for the MetaWeblog API.  The endpoint
        is the same endpoint that is used by the normal wiki RPC API.
        Currently only newPost and newMediaObject are supported.

2003-04-09  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * Added "style", "border", and "class" -attributes to the Image
        plugin.  Suggested by Foster Schucker.

        * v2.1.6.

2003-04-08  Erik Bunn  <Erik.Bunn@no_spam.ecyrd.com>

        * Modified FileSystemProvider, CachingProvider; added 
        SearchMatcher. CachingProvider now uses cached pages when
        searching. Both the cache and SearchMatcher can still be 
        improved a lot...

2003-04-07  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.1.5.

        * All plugins should now generate valid XHTML.

2003-04-06  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.1.4.

        * Added Image plugin, which allows one to have more fine layout
        control over images.  Suggested by many people, but the code base
        is all new.

        * RecentChangesPlugin now understands about baseURL (oops).  It is
        also now XHTML-compliant.

2003-04-04  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.1.3.

        * WebLogPlugin did not check if comments were disabled.

        * Added the CalendarTag patch for changing months from RoyW.

2003-04-03  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * Demoted log messages in IncludeTag to WARN level from FATAL.  It
        seems that including can fail on so many occasions that it does
        not make sens to call them as FATAL.  Reported by John Volkar.

        * Added new jspwiki.org home page information to different files.

2003-03-29  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * If the user name was received from container, JSPWiki would get
        confused if it contained spaces.  Reported by Foster Schucker.

        * v2.1.2.

        * The default template is now a bit more XHTML-compliant, but
        there is still a long way to go.  Slowly, slowly...

        * Changed the default template to have a "Go to top" -link at the
        bottom to ease navigation.  Suggested by Paul Downes.

2003-03-28  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * 2.1.1.

        * Added ListLocksPlugin to the default SystemInfo page.

        * Added "Save" button to Preview.  Thanks to Mark Anderson for the
        original code.

2003-03-27  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * Removed a bunch of extra imports to clean up the code a bit.
        Thanks to John Volkar for pointing these out.

2003-03-25  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * Branched off 2.1.0 development series.

2003-03-23  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * 2.0.36.  Stable 2.0!  YAY!

        * All of the tags are now documented.

        * Changed slightly DifferenceEngine code to output cleaner html.

        * BreadcrumbsTag did not work correctly with a load-balanced
        Resin.  Should work now. 

2003-03-11  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * Added some more documentation on tags.

        * default template changed slightly: cssinclude.js no longer uses
        the <noscript>-tag, and all of the tags were made lower-case for
        future XHTML compliancy.

2003-03-09  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * Started to write in the documentation of the different tags.

2003-03-08  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.0.35.

        * Bug fix: Preview would lose edits with Internet Explorer, IF you
        had authentication enabled.  Reported by John Volkar.  Fix by
        Torsten Hildebrandt.

        * Bug fix: XML-RPC code no longer lists attachments when asked for
        recent changes.  This would cause problems with multiple XML-RPC
        clients, since they would not know what was a page and what was
        not.  Reported by Steven Noels.

2003-03-02  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.0.34.

        * Just a tiny little code cleanup, binary should not have
        changed.  (There were a few places where magic numbers were used
        instead of WikiPageProvider.LATEST_VERSION).

        * JSPWiki license is now the GNU Lesser General Public License, so
        that people who want to embed JSPWiki as a part of their products,
        can do so.  It also makes it quite a lot easier to use third-party
        libraries. 

2003-03-01  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.0.33.

        * FileSystemProvider should now be a bit more verbose in case the
        page directory is not found.  This should help those who like to
        end their property entries with spaces :-).

        * BreadcrumbsTag had an off-by-one error: if you set the trail to
        be 10 in size, it would show only 9.  Patch contributed by Ken
        Liu.

2003-02-22  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.0.32.

        * AttachmentServlet now should work with UTF-8 filenames.
        Suggested by Torsten Hildebrandt.

        * UploadTemplate.jsp now always uses UTF-8 when submitting the
        form.  Also did slight changes to the outlook.

2003-02-21  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * Removed PageHeader.jsp from the default template since it was
        not used anywhere.  Reported by George Fairbanks.

        * Added new out.png from George Fairbanks, adding transparency.

        * BreadcrumbsTag now extends the correct class, so that it should
        no longer output an extra "</a>".  Reported by Santiago Gala.

2003-02-20  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.0.31.

        * Also added a bunch of tests.

        * '/' in a link is now recognized to form an attachment link.

        * Worked on some attachment-referencemanager related bugs.  Now
        attachments are recognized and reference better in some cases, but
        problems still remain:  If you create a link to an attachment
        first, but create the attachment later, the reference lists may
        not notice this.  This is a subtle problem.

2003-02-19  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.0.30.

        * Foster Schucker sent some patches so that CalendarTag looks
        better on Netscape 4.  Thanks!

2003-02-17  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.0.29.

        * Fixed a couple of small problems: WikiContext.COMMENT was
        missing, and a small change in EditTemplate.jsp allows Konqueror
        3.1 to work correctly with sites using UTF-8.

2003-02-14  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.0.28.

        * Incorporated "unterminated plugin causes OutOfMemoryException"
        fix from Torsten Hildebrandt.

        * Added new attachment icons from Paul Downes.  Thanks heaps!

        * Fixed split imports in Edit.jsp for better compatibility.
        Reported by Wouter.

        * Attachments version history is now sorted in correct order.
        Reported by Wouter. 

2003-02-12  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * Checked in a bunch of tests from Torsten Hildebrandt.  Most of
        them fail, which is not a good thing, but I haven't checked them
        thoroughly yet.

2003-02-08  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.0.27.

        * ListLocksPlugin now properly closes table.  Reported by Michael
        Gentry. 

2003-02-06  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * Small addition: The preferences cookie now expires in 1001 days
        instead of 90 days.  It turned out to be too fast.

2003-02-05  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.0.26.

        * Bug fix: BasicAttachmentProvider still didn't migrate correctly
        from earlier versions.  Sigh...  Patch provided by Torsten
        Hildebrandt.

        * Added Jason Pell's MultipartRequestLibrary v1.30b3, which should
        fix plenty of problems related with uploads.

2003-02-01  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.0.25.

        * BasicAttachmentProvider should now properly migrate from earlier
        versions of JSPWiki 2.0 beta.

        * Bug fix: downloading attachments that have non-ascii names
        should work now.  Uploading does not still work, because of bugs
        in httpmultipartrequest library.  Reported by Torsten
        Hildebrandt.  In addition UploadTemplate.jsp now explicitly
        specifies ISO-8859-1 encoding, which seems to work with Mozilla.

        * Bug fix: '}' inside plugins no longer stops parsing.  Reported
        by William Morgan, fix courtesy of Torsten Hildebrandt.
        
        * v2.0.24.

        * CalendarTag is now smarter and can adapt itself to the date.

        * Bug fix: WeblogPlugin would prefer the local parameter instead
        of the one given in HTTP parameters to decide how many days should
        be shown.

        * Bug fix: WeblogPlugin would sort entries wrong on month
        threshold.  Reported by Ebu.

2003-01-31  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.0.23.
        
        * WikiSecurityException is now in correct package.  Sorry, no
        other updates at this time.

2003-01-21  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.0.22.

        * Added ListLocksPlugin for admins.

        * v2.0.21.

        * Added a JDK1.4 -specific version of the input encoding detector
        to FileUtil.  This also means that JSPWiki can no longer be
        compiled using a 1.3 compiler anymore.  It will run on 1.3 systems
        however, unless something is amiss.

2003-01-19  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.0.20.
	
        * Fixed a couple of Windows tests failing.  This unfortunately
	means that all attachments are now renamed in a bit of a different
	way (a -dir) is attached to the attachment name.  You will need to
	change your old attachment names (mv attachment/
	attachment-dir/).  However, there is a built-in migration code,
	but you still should to the change.

        * v2.0.19.

        * Broke WikiAttachmentProvider as well with deletePage() and
        deleteVersion().

        * Added Breadcrumbs tag from Ken Liu.  The default template now
        also includes it.

        * v2.0.18.

        * Broke WikiPageProvider by adding deletePage() and
        deleteVersion() methods.

        * Fixed a multitude of bugs in the tests, courtesy of Torsten
        Hildebrandt.  For example, "ant guitests" should work now.

2003-01-17  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.0.17.

        * Plugin parsing is now stopped at }] instead of ].  Suggested by
        Alain Ravet and several other persons.

2003-01-14  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.0.16.

        * Changed the WikiPageProvider and WikiAttachmentProvider
        interfaces: getVersionHistory() should now always return a List
        instead of Collection.  All providers did this anyway, but for
        some strange reason I never remembered to update the return type.
        Logically a List is correct, since the result needs to be ordered.
        Sorry to everyone whose custom provider broke!

        * CachingProvider now checks the cache first when called with
        pageExists().  Suggested by Sulka Haro.

        * Removed a couple of deprecated methods from WikiEngine.

2003-01-12  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.0.15.

        * Added new variable "uptime", and WikiEngine.getStartTime().

2003-01-11  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.0.14.

        * SearchResultIteratorTag would crash if you hit "reload".  This
        was because the counter would never get reset between two
        consecutive refreshes, and Tomcat 4 pools tags.

2003-01-10  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.0.13.

        * WeblogPlugin and CalendarTag enhanced to work even better
        together: WeblogPlugin supports now the 'startDate' parameter,
        whereas CalendarTag supports an 'urlformat' parameter.

        * WikiContext now stores the incoming HTTP request as well.  This
        allows you to write plugins that can read the HTTP parameters as
        well, for example.  Please see the note in
        WikiContext.getHttpParameter(). 

2003-01-08  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * Added CalendarTag.  It's still in its very infancy, so it might
        not be very useful to others.

2003-01-05  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.0.12.

        * Diff.jsp did not use the templateDir property correctly.  Oops.
        Reported by Robert McGovern.

        * Added Expires, Last-Modified, and Cache-Control headers to
        Edit.jsp responses - this should allow certain versions of
        Internet Explorer to use Preview correctly.  Suggested by Richard
        Donkin.

        * Implemented page "locking".  When you now start to edit a page,
        the page is marked as being under editing, and the next guy will
        get a warning about that.  To facilitate this, Edit.jsp was
        changed.  Also, check out the new tags in "EditTemplate.jsp", and
        note also that the "Cancel" is now a button instead of a link.
        Suggested by Olli Lounela.

2003-01-03  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * Wrote some new documentation into sample wikipages.

        * v2.0.11.

        * All boolean type properties in jspwiki.properties recognize now
        "on" and "yes" as "true" as well.

        * It is now possible to allow raw HTML on WikiPages.  Beware, this
        is a very dangerous option, since it will allow people OTHER THAN
        THE ADMINISTRATOR to make wikis that can hurt users.  Requested
        (very loudly and many times :-) by Alain Ravet.

        * v2.0.10.

        * WeblogPlugin changed entry formats.  Beware, if you've been
        using it so far. 

        * WikiPage now implements Cloneable.  I have no idea why.

2002-12-29  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.0.9.

        * Added permalinks to WeblogPlugin.

        * IndexPlugin enhanced to have parameters "include" and "exclude",
        which can be used to include or exclude pages using standard glob
        wild card expressions (*, ?, etc).

2002-12-28  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.0.8.

        * Bug fix: VersioningFileProvider would mangle old versions of a
        page if they were in UTF-8 format.  Reported by Torsten
        Hildebrandt. 

2002-12-18  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.0.7.

        * Added new title beautifier code from Torsten Hildebrandt.  It's
        a bit different from what we used to have, but it does now less
        mistakes.  :-).

2002-12-16  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.0.6 - The I Should Really Be Sleeping But Let's See If Killer
        Can Keep Up With This Pace With His Debian Packages -release.

        * Inspiration continues.  Now ReferenceManager also understands
        about attachments, so they can now be cross-referenced, be on
        unused or undefined pages, etc.

2002-12-15  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.0.5.

        * RecentChanges now displays also changed attachments.  This added
        some new APIs in WikiAttachmentProvider and AttachmentManager.

        * v2.0.4.

        * Bug fix: Restoring previous versions from archive did not work.

        * Bug fix: Attempting to upload a non-existing file would cause a
        crash.  Reported by Alain Ravet and Paul Downes.

2002-12-14  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.0.3.

        * Bug fix: previewing a new page with a footnote would cause a
        crash. 

        * Added WikiAttachments page to the samplepage distro.
        
        * Redirected all references to Wiki.jsp or Edit.jsp through
        WikiEngine for future configurability.  Requested by Bart
        Selders.

        * Running tests now puts test pages into /tmp/testrepository.  Too
        many false alerts due to wrong files in /tmp/...

        * v2.0.2.

        * Bug fix: JSPWiki no longer dies horribly with OutOfMemoryError
        if preformatted code blocks ({{{ }}}) are not closed properly.
        We simply forgot to check for EOF :-).  Reported by Erik Bunn.

        * Bug fix: CamelCase is no longer recognized inside {{{ }}}
        blocks. Reported by Torsten Hildebrandt.

2002-12-11  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.0.1.

        * Attachments are now sent back using Content-Disposition: inline
        instead of Content-Disposition: attachment.  This means that they
        should now be opened automatically by browsers.  Suggested by
        Torsten Hildebrandt.

        * Interwiki references that lead out of the wiki are now also
        tagged with the outlink image.  Reported by Alain Ravet.

        * Outlink images are now on by default.

2002-12-09  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v2.0.0-alpha.

        * Fixed WikiEngine.beautifyTitle() to work better with acronyms.

        * Moved GoRankAggregator and GoDiagram plugins into their own,
        separate project. 

2002-12-09  Erik Bunn  <Erik.Bunn@spamicide.basen.net>

        * v1.9.50.
        
        * Fixed null reference bug in AttachmentManager when no
        manager specified in jspwiki.properties.
        
        * Added Error.jsp, which displays the message of an 
        exception using DisplayMessage.jsp (in templates).
        Added Error.jsp as error page of all top level jsp's.

2002-12-08  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.9.49.

        * All referral plugins (UnusedPages,UndefinedPages, and
        ReferringPagesPlugin) now support a parameter "separator", which
        basically contains the wiki markup that should be used to separate
        the entires.  Suggested by Jeremy Cowgar.

2002-12-08  Erik Bunn  <Erik.Bunn@spamicide.basen.net>

        * Modified exception classes to inherit WikiException
        (with the exception of InternalWikiException =).
        
        * Added SecurityException in preparation for auth merge.

2002-12-07  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.9.48.

        * Tiny little tweaks to attachments all around.

        * PageInfo is now attachment-aware, so you can view older
        versions, etc. using the standard PageInfo link.

        * If an attachment is an image, then it is automatically inlined.

        * It is now possible to link to attachments as if they were normal
        Wiki pages.  From the page itself, just use [attachment name],
        from other pages, use [ParentPage/attachment name].

        * v1.9.47.

        * CamelCase links now finally work (or at least all tests run).
        Thanks to Joonas Iivonen for inspiration, and listening my
        incoherent explanation about the problem. :-)

        * List items (*, #) are now closed properly as per XHTML spec.
        We still have paragraphs to go, but otherwise we're nearly XHTML
        compliant. 

2002-12-06  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.9.46.

        * Major import of all attachments code.  This version is actually
        able to upload/download attachments, but I wouldn't use this for
        any real production.  The structure may change and you may face a
        difficult process to migrate your old attachments to a new
        system.  

        * Added attachment_big.png, thanks to Tero Tiittanen.

        * v1.9.45.

        * Many changes to GoRankAggregator, which you probably won't care
        about. 

        * Added fix for JBoss and pure WAR-file deployment from Xyvind
        Lxkling.

2002-12-05  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.9.44.

        * CamelCase detection changed yet again.  However, this will still
        fail when you write wikimarkup right next to it: For example
        __CamelCase__ will result into something totally strange, much
        like *CamelCase to start a line.  Using whitespace should work,
        though...  __ CamelCase __ should be quite okay.

2002-12-04  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.9.43.

        * Bug fix: TranslatorReader did not properly closed down the <img>
        -tags, as per XHTML specification.  Let's see how many old
        browsers break this time... :-)

        * Bug fix: Preformatted text was not properly closed down if the
        user forgot all about it.  Reported by Bob Schulze.

        * Bug fix: Preformatted text ({{{) no longer allows you to input
        HTML.  Reported by Bob Schulze.

        * New option: jspwiki.translatorReader.useOutlinkImage allows you
        to mark all outgoing links with a small picture.  Thanks to Teemu
        HirsimBB??dki for providing with the idea and the image.  Look for
        images/out.png, if you want to change it.

2002-12-01  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * GoRankAggregator now also supports 'egfurl' parameter, which
        fetches country-specific ranking data from persons.  Quite
        kludgish at the moment.

        * Hopefully fixed GoRankAggregator to allow multiple persons of
        the same rank.

2002-11-29  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * Added GoRankAggregator.  Most of you don't probably care.  (I
        probably should make these a separate distribution or something.)
        I won't even bother to bump the version number for this one.

2002-11-26  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.9.42.

        * Fixed a near-fatal bug in UserPreferences.jsp - we wrote the
        page contents into the stream and then did a redirect.  Oops.

        * Radical change warning: If you are running a Wiki with that has
        authentication turned on, note that from now on the username set
        in UserPreferences is the one that gets put in page change
        history, not the name the user used to authenticate himself.  This
        was done so that it would be easier to maintain a wiki that has
        only a single username/password combination and still track the
        users.   I believe this is more in line with WikiNature.
        
        You can still see the name the user used to authenticate in the
        log file that JSPWiki generates.

        * v1.9.41.

        * Fixed EditTemplate.jsp to show the link to EditPageHelp in a
        manner consistent with other edit links.

        * EditLinkTag would crash if the page it was referring to did not
        exist.  Reported by Torsten Hildebrand.

        * Fixed camelcase patch from Jeff Phillips - thanks Jeff!

2002-11-24  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.9.40.

        * Instead of doing ServletContext.getRealPath("/") we now use the
        ServletContext itself as an unique key when creating a
        WikiEngine.  This should resolve problems when running JSPWiki
        straight from a WAR file.  Reported by Oyvind Loekling.

        * Added plenty of code for attachments.  Storing and retrieving
        works, as well as listing.  However, uploading still has some
        problems. 

2002-11-20  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.9.39.

        * DiffLink now fails gracefully if page does not exist.  Reported
        by Jeremy C.
        
        * Fixed ~ -escaping of CamelCase links.

        * Added patch from Kabe Robichaux to fix a problem with older RCS
        programs that do not support the -z flag.

        * v1.9.38.

        * The "&" translation now occurs _before_ other entities, which no
        longer causes all quotes to be transformed back into "&quot;"
        while you're editing a page.

        * Integrated camelcase patch from Jeff Phillips.  It is now nearly
        working - a couple more tests should go through first.

2002-11-11  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.9.37.

        * <BR/> is now <BR />, in order not to confuse some older
        browsers.

2002-11-09  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.9.36.

        * GoDiagram now uses PNG images.  It also now honors the baseURL
        setting.

        * Tables now close the <TD> tag correctly with </TD>, thanks to
        the new TranslatorReader architecture.  Reported by Andreas
        Rozek.

        * "&" is now translated into "&amp;" when editing, so that you can
        actually input HTML entities and they stay like that when going
        into storage.  Reported by Erik Bunn and others.

        * Tilde (~) now escapes bars in tables.

        * v1.9.35.

        * GoDiagram is now a bit more tolerant towards the kind of markup
        it accepts.

        * Bug fix: godiagram was off-by-one towards the side of the
        board.  Reported by Paavo Pietarila.

2002-11-08  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * We now output <BR/> instead of <BR>.  Slowly working towards
        full XHTML :-).

        * Several small bugfixes: ([[ not working, single {'s getting
        destroyed, etc.)

        * Removed clear=all from HR, added \\\ to do a <br clear=all>.  HR
        looked quite odd.

        * ":" after the first no longer breaks description lists.        

        * v1.9.34.

        * ---- aka HR tag now adds 'clear=all' attribute to accommodate
        aligned images, such as the ones produced by GoDiagram.

        * GoDiagram now works.

2002-11-07  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.9.33.

        * New plugin: GoDiagram.

        * A couple of bugfixes: some EOL issues in multi-line plugins.

2002-11-07  Erik Bunn  <Erik.Bunn@nospam.memecry.net>

        * Added plugin execution disabling, and disabled 
        their execution during the initial reference manager scan.
        This is mainly important in wiki's with lots of complex custom
        plugins.
        
2002-11-07  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.9.32.

        * True multiline plugins that no longer conflict with WikiMarkup
        are now available!  Yay!

        * MAJOR breakdown!  Rewrote practically everything in
        TranslatorReader: it is now fully stream-based instead of
        line-based, which makes many things quite a lot easier.  It should
        also be quite a lot faster than before.  
        
        CamelCase links are TOTALLY broken in this revision, since the
        stream-based system makes it a bit difficult to run the regexp on
        them.  We'll see how to get them back running again.
        
        Do NOT use this revision for any production work... We have many
        tests that still fail!

2002-11-06  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.9.31.

        * More attachment support.  Still not functional, but at least now
        you can see where we're going.

        * Fixed support for multiline plugins.

2002-11-01  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.9.30.

        * The INSERT is no longer required to signify plugins.  It is
        recommended, but not required.  This at the request of many people
        who are using an insane amount of plugins :-).

        * New plugin: Counter.

        * Added support to VariableManager to display Context Variables.

        * Added Wiki Context Variables.  These exist solely in the
        WikiContext class, and allow you to define transient variables on
        a pageview basis.

        * Added a patch to allow multiline plugins from ebu.
        Unfortunately, this does not work fully yet - newlines in the
        middle of arguments break stuff.

2002-10-29  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.9.29.

        * Added a new property: "jspwiki.frontPage".  This allows you to
        easily change the default page name from "Main" into something
        else.  This is important if you're doing localized installations,
        for example.

2002-10-23  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.9.28.

        * Just incorporated a bit more attachment stuff.  Also fixed the
        problem of AttachmentManager complaining at startup, if no
        attachmentProvider was defined.

2002-09-30  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.9.27.

        * CamelCase links can now be stopped from occurring by prepending
        it with '~'.  ~CamelCase results in "CamelCase", not a link to a
        page called CamelCase.  '~' will from now on be a generic negator
        tool for all sorts of purposes.

2002-09-29  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.9.26.

        * Added the ability to restore older versions of pages relatively
        trivially.  This is done by going viewing the old version via
        PageInfo, then clicking on "Restore this version".  You'll be
        presented with a edit view to the page.
        
        Note: this facility has changed the default template, too, so if
        you have made your own templates, you probably want to modify them
        too to allow this facility.

2002-09-17  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.9.25.

        * Viewing of old versions would not show the "this is version XX"
        -banner because of an unclosed JSP comment.  Oops.

        * PageInfo now shows "no versions" if there is no version history
        available instead of an empty string.

        * HistoryIteratorTag would fail if there was no version history
        (like when you were moving from FileSystemProvider to
        RCSFileProvider).  Now fixed.

        * CachingProvider now checks if the requested version is cached,
        and not only when the version is marked as latest.  Combined with
        the new template system, this bug caused CachingProvider to
        effectively ignore its own cache.

        * ---- aka HR is now <HR /> as per XHTML spec.

2002-09-15  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.9.24.

        * Exceptions from plugins is now clearly separated from WikiEngine
        internals.  Suggested by Niilo Neuvo.

2002-09-08  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * JSPWiki repository should now have anonymous CVS access.
        Everything should now work.

        * v1.9.23.

        * Bug fix: no longer crashes if baseURL is not defined.  Reported
        by Alain Ravet.

        * Fixed a problem when trying to escape '[' character using '[['.

2002-09-07  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.9.22.

        * SearchResult uses now "WikiPage" instead of a String to the page
        name.  Heed this, if you have your own implementation of a
        provider.

        * VariableTag now has a "default" attribute which gets invoked if
        the variable in question does not exist.

        * The top right search box didn't work - now it does.

        * You can now limit the number of hits a search returns - see
        FindContent.jsp and the maxItems parameter of SearchResultIterator
        tag.

        * Search.jsp also tagified.

        * UserPreferences now directs you back to the prefs page instead
        of Wiki.jsp.

        * UserPreferences now check the validity of the given username,
        and will turn it into a valid WikiName.

        * UserPreferences.jsp is now also tagified (to some extent
        anyway) and should now work.

2002-09-03  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.9.21

        * Bug fix: Two plugins on the same line would not always work as
        expected.  I had to rewrite the entire
        TranslatorReader.insertHyperLinks() method... As a nice side
        effect, it's now like five times faster than before. :-)
        
        * Added a simple WeblogPlugin and an accompanying
        WeblogEntryPlugin.

        * It is now possible to add jspwiki.properties properties as
        WikiVariables. 

        * Documented WikiVariables.

2002-09-02  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * Added new tag "Plugin", which allows you to run any JSPWiki
        plugin from a JSP page directly.

        * Fixed the last failing RCSFileProvider test case.

2002-09-01  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.9.20.

        * Added a new variable system, including an all-new
        VariableManager.  For example, "applicationname" tag was removed
        as obsolete.  You may add variables using a [{$foobar}] -notation
        on wiki pages, and with the wiki:Variable tag on the JSP pages.
        
        * PageModified.jsp and Preview.jsp are now included in the new
        template system.
        
        * SystemInfo.jsp is now removed.  A page called "SystemInfo" is
        taking its place.

        * Creating new pages should work now again.
        
        * Edit.jsp should no longer crash.  It's also been delegated
        properly into EditTemplate.jsp.

        * Added jspwiki.templateDir property.

        * Fixed PageInfo display - it now actually generates correct
        links. 

        * Fixed DiffLinkTag to actually generate correct links.

2002-08-29  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.9.19.

        * Plenty of changes to the JSP pages: created 8 new tags, shuffled
        things around.  Everything is still broken, but doc/Templates.txt
        should explain what we're about to do.

2002-08-19  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.9.18.

        * Moved stuff around, as plural forms of page names were not
        considered to exist by many of the internal routines, confusing
        UndefinedPages for example.  Found by Leigh Dodds.

2002-08-18  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.9.17.

        * All of the pages should now work.

        * Added Translate tag for writing Wiki content directly from the
        page.

        * Non-existing pages would crash both Wiki.jsp and Edit.jsp.  Now
        fixed.  Reported by Alain Ravet.

        * v1.9.16.

        * ViewTemplate.jsp is now done totally in tags.

        * Diff.jsp is now done totally in tags.

        * Added new tags: CheckVersion, InsertDiff, PageExists,
        PageVersion, PageDate.

2002-08-17  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.9.15.

        * Added a couple of new tags.

        * Moved all CSS files and cssinclude.js into the templates/default
        directory.

        * Split Edit.jsp and PageInfo.jsp into a scriptlet page, and a
        HTML template.  Some pages still do not work yet.

2002-08-16  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.9.14.

        * Moved the current view templates to templates/defaults.  This
        probably broke quite a lot of stuff...

2002-08-09  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.9.13.

        * JSPWiki now writes a better separator to log when it starts to
        make it easier to see new log entires.  Suggested by Mikael
        Honkala.

2002-08-01  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.9.12.

        * Added PageInfoLink tag.

2002-07-31  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.9.11.

        * Even more JSP tags added, including a new "Permission" tag.

2002-07-25  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.9.10.
        
        * Forgot to call link mutators with CamelCase links.  This caused
        CamelCase links disappearing from things like "Referenced by"
        -list.  Reported by Alain Ravet.

        * Added ';term:def' to TextFormattingRules for definition lists.
        This incidentally also allows you to make comments into someone
        else's text, if you use an empty 'term' (;:<Comment here>).

2002-07-24  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>
        
        * v1.9.9.

        * Moved LeftMenu, LeftMenuFooter, PageHeader into templates/.

        * Added new WikiPages: PageIndex, EditPageHelp.

        * Moved Edit.jsp embedded help into a WikiPage called
        "EditPageHelp".

        * Bug fix: In rare occasions VersioningFileProvider would not
        return correct page information.

        * More JSP tags implemented.

        * Added new plugin "IndexPlugin", by Alain Ravet.

2002-07-23  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.9.8. (The afternoon version.)

        * Changed the default Edit.jsp background to something else, since
        so many people are running with the default.  I told you it was
        ugly - I am not sure the new version is any better :-).

        * Moved ViewTemplate.jsp into templates/

        * Added AuthorTag.

        * v1.9.7.

        * Links to existing pages inside image links now generate an
        automatic link to that page.  Suggested by Alain Ravet.

2002-07-22  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.9.6.

        * Started the (painful) move to JSP tags.  Sigh.  I couldn't
        really figure out a better way - unfortunately we now have to
        stand with the performance penalty that JSP tags give us.  This
        includes new WikiTagBase class, which contains some helpers.

        * Split Wiki.jsp into Wiki.jsp and ViewTemplate.jsp.  All HTML
        code should go to the latter one.

        * Incorporated fix from 1.8.2: UserProfiles might be broken on
        some containers.  Reported by Kalle Kivimaa.

        * Incorporated fix from 1.8.2: new page diffs are now shown
        properly.  Reported by Niilo Neuvo.

2002-07-11  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.9.5.

        * Fixed problem with RSS generating illegal XML in certain cases
        (& and < were not translated to entities properly).

        * Fixed problem with plugin output getting translated by
        reordering the translator routines.  This may break many things,
        so please be careful.  Reported by Niilo Neuvo.

2002-07-07  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.9.4.

        * Fixed problem with VersioningFileProvider failing if the
        corresponding history file was not located.  This might have been
        an issue while upgrading from FileSystemProvider to
        VersioningFileProvider.

        * Moved some heavier stuff from tests to package "stresstests" to
        make running unit tests faster. 

2002-07-04  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.9.3

        * Fixed a serious problem with CamelCase links screwing up if you
        had more than two links on the same line.

2002-07-01  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.9.2

        * JSPWiki now supports traditional, CamelCase (or InterCapping)
        WikiLinks without square brackets.  However, this feature is
        turned off by default, so you'll have to edit the correct property
        in the jspwiki.properties file.

2002-06-30  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.9.1

        * Changed WikiEngine initialization so that it would better
        integrate with servlets and/or standalone systems.  However, this
        does not yet work as-expected, if you're using it, you'll see all
        sorts of annoying NullPointerExceptions if things go wrong.

        * Moved some of the functionality from WikiEngine into a new
        PageManager class.

        * Integrated some initial parts of the attachment package from
        ebu.  Does not work yet, though.

        * Did some code cleanup: We now have a proper WikiException (with
        our own exceptions extending from it).  There is now also a new
        WikiProvider interface, which WikiPageProvider and
        AttachmentProvider extend from.

        * You should no longer set CachingProvider directly, but to use
        jspwiki.usePageCache instead.  I did this change since in many bug
        reports it turned out that practically nobody was using the page
        cache - presumably because nobody knew about it :-).

2002-06-25  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * Branched off 1.9.x, which is to be 2.0.  This means that it's
        quite likely that anything from CVS is no longer functioning =).

        * You can now specify the used page provider without the package
        name in the jspwiki.properties file.

        * Major change: All WikiPageProviders now live in their own, neat
        little package.  This means that all jspwiki property files just
        broke, unfortunately.

2002-06-20  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.8.0.

        * A second property: jspwiki.matchEnglishPlurals automatically
        allows you to consider "Thing" and "Things" the same word.
        Unfortunately, it's not perfect (it can't tell the difference
        between SandBox and SandBoxes, for example).

        * PageHeader.jsp now splits the title into separate words, if the
        correct property is set in jspwiki.properties.  Suggested by
        Steven Owens.

        * PageModified.jsp now does word wrapping.  It's still not
        beautiful, but it works.

        * Links starting with "file:" are now recognized as external
        links, not interwiki links anymore.

        * InterWiki links no longer go through URLEncoder, because URL
        encoding removes things like slashes.  Which is annoying, and
        probably not you want.  You'll just now have to be more careful
        when writing InterWiki links.  Reported by GarethSB.

2002-06-09  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.7.10.

        * Added new property: jspwiki.plugin.searchPath, which allows you
        to add any package name for searching plugins.  Suggested by Niilo
        Neuvo.

        * RSS feed was fixed - we now also add the <items> list.  Changed
        also the dc:contributor field to use the rdf:Description element
        rather than the direct name, since it would not work with all RSS
        aggregators.

        * Wiki.jsp now displays the XML sign for easy subscription to the
        RSS feed.  We also display the Radio coffee mug for easy
        subscription for Radio Userland users (though this is untested,
        could any Radio folks test it, please?)

        * We now support RSS autodiscovery, as per the proposed standard
        at
        http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/06/02.html#important_change_to_the_link_tag.

2002-06-03  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * Oops, compiling broke on some systems due to undeclared
        exceptions.

2002-06-01  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * Feature: WikiEngine now remembers the ServletContext it was
        initialized with, and you can get it via
        WikiEngine.getServletContext().  Requested by Niilo Neuvo.

2002-05-31  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * Bug fix: in case the specified page directory does not exist,
        FileSystemProvider now throws an FileNotFoundException.  Suggested
        by Niilo Neuvo.

2002-05-22  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.7.9.

        * Hooray - JSPWiki is no longer dependant on RCS in any form.  We
        now have an internal diff routine courtesy of BMSI.  This means
        that on Windows you can just use the VersioningFileProvider and
        you no longer need to do anything with the RCS.

2002-05-19  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * UserPreferences now allows you to clear the preferences.
        Suggested by Robert McGovern, who kindly sent me a patch for it.

2002-05-11  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.7.8.

        * Added CurrentTimePlugin, which allows you to tell the server
        time.  Added documentation to JSPWikiPlugins, and also a sample to
        RecentChanges.

        * PluginManager also now understands quoted parameters, i.e. if
        you enclose a parameter value in single quotes ('), you can use
        spaces and other annoying creatures inside the parameter
        values. This is very handy for the CurrentTimePlugin.

        * PluginManager no longer needs the full package name, if the
        plugin is a JSPWiki-supplied plugin.  We first try with the class
        name as given, then prepend "com.ecyrd.jspwiki.plugin" and try
        again.  This should make putting plugins on your own page a bit
        simpler.

2002-05-09  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * Added temporary fix for misbehaving, nested #'s and *'s.
        However, this is not a real fix, it just prevents the system from
        going all wonky.  Reported by Mahlen Morris.

        * Fixed problem with XML-RPC interface method listLinks()
        generating incorrect HREF attribute for nonexistant links.
        Reported by Mahlen Morris.

2002-05-07  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.7.7.

        * Bug fix: UTF-8 version of XML-RPC client missed
        getRecentChanges() totally.  Apparently nobody was using it =).

        * Bug fix: RPC.getRecentChanges() would accidentally use local
        time instead of UTC.  Oops.  Found by Mahlen Morris.

2002-04-19  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.7.6.

        * RSS feed is now richer.  I also added MANY settings to
        jspwiki.properties, all starting with "jspwiki.rss".  It should
        allow you to configure pretty much everything related to the RSS
        feed.

2002-04-18  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * RSS feed is now generated in the proper directory.  If you're not
        running WikiEngine as a servlet, then the value of the "user.dir"
        system property (the current working directory) is used.

        * v1.7.5.

        * Added an initial stab at an RSS feed.  Currently it just lists
        the changed pages, but perhaps in the near future it can do more
        complex stuff.

2002-04-14  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.7.4.

        * UserPreferences is now a lot more tolerant towards UTF-8
        characters.

        * Everything rebuilt to survive a null author information.

        * The text for inline images is now interpreted as a hyperlink, if
        it starts with the usual http:, ftp:, mailto:, etc.  Suggested by
        Alain Ravet.

2002-03-27  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.7.3.

        * Added capability to set your user name via UserPreferences
        page.  This data is stored as a cookie in your browser.

2002-03-25  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.7.2.

        * When a page is saved, it gets now automatically normalized.
        This normalizing means that all pages will now end with a newline
        (some browsers send a newline and some don't), and also that ALL
        line breaks are now marked with \r\n (CRLF, MS-DOS style).  Why
        with that obsolete style?  Well, HTTP standard uses CRLF all
        around, and most of the current JSPWiki installations use CRLF in
        all of the files.  Also, most UNIX tools are smart enough to
        understand CRLF, whereas not all Windows tools understand plain
        CR (Mac style) or plain LF.  Using CRLF should make installing
        this upgrade totally visible to most users.
        
        Having said that, this has not been tested very many times,
        obviously.  Use with care :-).

2002-03-22  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.7.1.

        * Edit.jsp had a javascript error, pointing at a wrong form.  It
        was not fatal, it did not affect the user in any real way, other
        than being an annoyance.

        * DifferenceEngine no longer crashes if it gets empty lines from
        diff. 

2002-03-21  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * Added preview capability to Edit.jsp.  Suggested by many
        people.

        * Added Preview.jsp.  This is still a very simple preview, which
        does not allow you to do a direct publish.

2002-03-16  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.7.0.  Finally :-).

2002-03-10  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * Added VersioningFileProvider.  The VersioningFileProvider is
        STRICTLY ALPHA.  DO NOT USE IT FOR ANY REAL PROJECT.  But please,
        do test it :-).

        * v1.6.13-cvs.

        * getRecentChanges() XML-RPC method now hopefully does UTC
        conversion correctly.

        * Search.jsp now offers to search on Google as well after giving
        you the results.

        * Added plenty of documentation about the XML-RPC interface to the
        distribution.

        * Footnotes are now unique across Wiki.  This is accomplished by
        adding the page name to the anchor name.  Suggested by Mahlen
        Morris.

2002-03-07  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * Edit.jsp text editor now knows how to adjust its own width
        according to browser window width, if your browser knows CSS.
        Thanks to Matthew Simoneau for the tip.

        * Included a new version of xmlrpc.jar: this version just has the
        default charset set to "UTF-8" instead of ISO-Latin-1.

        * RPCServlet now takes two initParams: "handler" to point at the
        class that is used to handle the XML-RPC call, and "prefix" to
        determine the XML-RPC command prefix.  We use these to start both
        the UTF-8 and strict XML-RPC handlers from web.xml.

        * Added AbstractRPCHandler and RPCHandlerUTF8 classes so that we
        can now also serve XML-RPC using UTF-8 :-).

2002-02-25  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * XML-RPC listLinks now returns a the type as a string.  Suggested
        by Mahlen Morris.

        * XML-RPC listLinks now returns an extra parameter: href.  This
        contains the actual link text from the HTML page itself.
        Suggested by Mahlen Morris.

        * InterWiki references are now also added to the link of external
        links returned by listLinks().  They are returned as entire URLs,
        resulting from resolving the reference.

2002-02-24  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.6.12-beta.

        * Added XML-RPC command "listLinks".

        * Did some code reorganization: New class DifferenceEngine now
        handles all diffs.  This was done in preparation for internal diff
        handling.  Also, LinkCollector is now a class of its own.

        * XML-RPC Command prefix is now "wiki" instead of "jspwiki".

2002-02-23  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * XML-RPC interface no longer relies on overloading of method
        names: All versioned versions have now "Version" appended.
        Suggested by Les Orchard.

        * XML-RPC interface now returns an error code of 1, if the
        requested page does not exist.  Suggested by Les Orchard.

        * Bug fix: Now tables should finally work with Mozilla.

        * Added Google search as an Interwiki link.

        * Diff.jsp now shows if there has been no difference.

        * Bug fix: Interwiki links were cleaned accidentally.

2002-02-21  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * Ebu rearranged web.xml to work with Tomcat 4.0, but forgot to
        mention it here.

        * Added some more default InterWiki references (TWiki,
        MeatballWiki, Wikipedia).

2002-02-15  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * PageInfo and Edit now also include PageHeader.jsp.  Suggested by
        Kim Holviala.

        * v1.6.11-beta.

        * XML-RPC interface now supports a new method:
        getRPCVersionSupported(), which returns which version of API we
        support.  This is currently 1.

        * Fixed <TT> support: it is now actually possible to write
        multiple lines using {{ and }}, much like it is with '' and __.
        Suggested by Sesh Jalagam.

        * Rewrote table support.  The TranslatorReader engine is now a lot
        smarter about things than it used to be, and now it does not
        matter how you use the table marker, as long as it's the first
        character on the line.

2002-02-14  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * Bug fix: RCSFileProvider could hang in certain operations,
        especially with long revision histories.  A JUnit test was added
        for this.

2002-02-10  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.6.10-cvs

        * XML-RPC interface now hopefully gives out the modification time
        in UTC, before it used the local timezone.

2002-02-09  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * Unused and undefined pages are now sorted.  Suggested by Mikael
        Honkala.

        * Using the table directive now causes an explicit "BORDER=1" to
        be output to support older browsers.  Also, reworked some of the
        stylesheets so that IE and Konqueror at least look the same now.
        Mozilla is still having problems with THEAD stylesheets.

2002-02-06  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.6.9-cvs

        * Added support for tables.  Sanna VBBB??dBBB??dtBBB??dinen finally managed to
        convince me to add them, by pointing out some real deficiences in
        the preformatted-text style tables =).

        * TextUtil.replaceString() would trash replacements of lengths of
        two or more.  Oops.

        * XML-RPC interface now goes around the UTF-8 problem by giving
        out Base64-encoded UTF-8 data as page data, and expects all page
        names to be strings encoded using URL encoding with UTF-8 text.
        This is regardless of the actual encoding used by the JSPWiki
        engine.

        * ReferringPagesPlugin now has extra parameter: "extras", which
        can be used to note how many pages are still left with references
        to this particular page.

        * Fixed a serious bug in CachingProvider, which caused null values
        to be added to the internal page collection.  Thanks to Mahlen
        Morris for pointing it out.

        * New class: InternalWikiException which gets thrown in case
        something really fishy and serious is going on inside Wiki.

2002-02-03  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * Fixed a slow routine in TranslatorReader, shaving off roughly
        10% of translation time.  Construction Exceptions is truly heavy.

2002-01-30  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.6.8-cvs

        * CachingProvider was iterating through the wrong collection.
        This might fix the NullPointerExceptions that have been coming
        around lately.

2002-01-28  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.6.7-cvs

        * Added new RPC API: getPageInfo( string page ), and getPageInfo(
        string page, int version ).  Also, the struct returned by
        getRecentChanges() and getPageInfo() got enhanced.

        * Wiki.jsp now shows the info on old versions properly: before it
        would show data pertaining to the current version, even if viewing
        an older version.

        * WikiPageProvider interface reworked slightly: Both getPageInfo()
        and getPageText() now need the version parameter.  Versionless
        methods are no longer supported (use LATEST_VERSION as a special
        tag for version to get the latest.)  I did this to simplify the
        API so that there would be less methods to implement.

        * RCSFileProvider can now fetch information on old pages
        correctly. 

2002-01-27  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.6.6-cvs.

        * Added XML-RPC call system.  See the com.ecyrd.jspwiki.xmlrpc
        package for more information.

        * Error output from RCS commands is now visible in the log.

        * Diff.jsp now has links to the actual page and the Page Info.

        * Some more refactoring inside WikiEngine: removed redundant
        code.

        * Refactored TranslatorReader to be more modular.  Provided hooks
        into the internals, so that links can now be read on-the-fly.

        * WikiEngine.getInstance() is now protected against multiple
        concurrent invocations.  This should help with startup issues.

2002-01-25  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * CachingProvider now provides some protection against
        concurrency, but it is known to fail at occasion.

        * Fixed a NullPointerException in Wiki.jsp, if the page did not
        exist.

        * Changed bottom line ordering in Wiki.jsp so that it takes less
        vertical screen space.

2002-01-20  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * SystemInfo.jsp page enhanced with new features.

        * v1.6.5-cvs

        * The WikiPageProvider interface has been enhanced with new
        methods.

        * CachingProvider reworked.  The getAllPages() now keeps its own
        cache, so that it can return the required pages without going
        through the actual provider.  This should speed things up a lot.
        A real solution is, however required.

2002-01-13  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * Added CachingProvider, inspired by Chris Brooking (though in a
        far simpler form).

        * v1.6.4-cvs.

        * RecentChanges list now displays author info.

        * All referral plugins (UnusedPages, UndefinedPages,
        ReferringPages) now recognize a "maxwidth" parameter, which can be
        used to limit the size of the written links.  This is very useful
        in the context of putting an automatic referral list to the
        LeftMenu, which might otherwise grow too wide.  The default
        LeftMenuFooter now reflects this.

        * Added the ability to modify the written link to the
        TranslatorReader by hooking in a StringTransmutator callback.

2002-01-10  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * PageModified.jsp wouldn't compile - I forgot to update the new
        location for TextUtil.replaceString().  Oops.

2002-01-09  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * SystemInfo.jsp now shows the used character encoding as well.

2002-01-07  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.6.3-beta.
        
        * Changed my email address.

        * Slightly changed ebu's hack to colorize diffs to work on all
        browsers, even those that are CSS-challenged.  Instead of
        DIV-tags and CSS-files, we now rely on tables.

        * Possibly fixed a problem with Win2k and RCS by rewriting the
        regular expression used to fetch the author name.  Thanks to Sesh
        Jalagam for the tip.

2002-01-06  Erik Bunn  <Erik.Bunn@nospam.memecry.net>

        * Fixed bug in referrals; when removing links to non-existant
        pages, unused pages no longer shows the removed link.

2001-12-13  Erik Bunn  <Erik.Bunn@nospam.memecry.net>

        * Initial hack to make diffs prettier implemented. Relies
        on CSS, uses lots of DIV tags, and the mac/ie css'es haven't
        been tested. 

2001-12-04  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * cssinclude.js now also sets some basic LINK elements: "start"
        refers to a page called "Main", "help" directs you to
        TextFormattingRules, and "search" takes you to Search.jsp.  The
        bad thing is that now the page names are pretty much fixed.

2001-12-03  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.6.2-cvs.

        * Wiki.jsp now has a direct link from the last change date to the
        latest change.

        * PageInfo.jsp can now display differences between a previous
        version and the current version.

        * Diff.jsp now handles requests for current version as well.

2001-12-01  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.6.1-cvs.

        * Removed last traces of JSP tags.

        * Changed plugin parameter marker to WHERE instead of WITH.

2001-11-25  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * Added new property: jspwiki.baseURL to define protection against
        URL rewriting gateways.  Requested by Kim Holviala.

        * Added the entire plugin system, making many JSP pages obsolete.
        New classes include PluginManager, taking care of the plugins.

        * Added com.ecyrd.jspwiki.plugin package with new plugin classes:
        RecentChangesPlugin, UnusedPagesPlugin, UndefinedPagesPlugin,
        ReferringPagesPlugin.

2001-11-23  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * Moved TranslatorReader.replaceString() to TextUtil, since it is
        a more logical place.

2001-11-23  Erik Bunn  <Erik.Bunn@nospam.memecry.net>

        * Added ReferenceManager and utilizing features. JSPWiki can
        now keep track of unused and undefined pages, and of pages 
        referring to a given page. Initial version, very unoptimized.
        See ReferenceManager.java and UnusedPages.jsp.

2001-11-20  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * Now replaces HTML entities correctly also in getText().  Thanks
        to Kim Holviala for pointing this one out.

        * This is release v1.6.0.

        * Quotes in HTML text is now escaped using &quot;

2001-11-18  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.5.8.

        * Fixed problem with UTF-8 decoding trashing a variable.  Thanks
        to Chris Brooking.

        * Searching in UTF-8 files now works.

2001-11-14  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * TranslatorReader now takes a Reader instead of BufferedReader.

        * Reworked some of the internals of WikiEngine and
        TranslatorReader, making them easier to read.

        * v1.5.7-beta.

        * Incorporated fix from Chris Brooking for the URL encoding, a
        workaround for JDK bug #4257115.

2001-11-11  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.5.6

        * Added NDC for all major JSP pages to make them simpler to
        debug. 

        * All pages now also export the META Content-Type information to
        support older browsers.

        * Possibly fixed a problem with readContents() throwing an
        IOException: "invalid mark" by increasing buffer size.

        * RCS commands now inherit the parent environment.  This might
        help with some Windows-related issues.

2001-11-08  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * Prevent robots from caching Edit, Diff, PageInfo and
        PageModified - not much point in caching those, really.

        * v1.5.5-beta.

        * Bug fix: Starting a new page no longer results as 'null' as the
        initial text.  Oops.

2001-11-07  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.5.4

        * Now FileSystemProvider and RCSFileProvider default back to
        ISO-8859-1 if the data is obviously not UTF-8.  This makes
        upgrading much easier.

        * Oops, diff forgot to use the chosen character encoding, and
        would assume ISO-8859-1.

2001-11-06  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.5.3

        * Bug fix: the RCSFileProvider used UTC instead of local time.
        Now fixed.  If you've changed the logcommands in
        jspwiki.properties, check the new format, or you'll be burned.

        * JSPWiki can now handle also non-ISO-8859-1 charsets.  Check
        README for more info.  Thanks to  Chris Brooking for the initial
        code.  This is a heavy-duty change - most of the JSP pages were
        affected, since they need to decode the page names in a new way.

        * v1.5.2

        * For browsers that do not support CSS, Wiki.jsp now also uses
        explicit FONT when displaying version information.

        * Empty list items could cause crashes in parsing.  Now fixed,
        thanks to Mikael Honkala for reporting this.

        * Oops, it was possible to put Javascript inside external or image
        links.  Now fixed - all quotes inside link names are URLEncoded.

2001-11-04  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>
        
        * v1.5.1
        
        * Added WikiEngine.saveText( String, String, HttpServletRequest )
        so that it can get the author information from the request.  The
        old API is still supported.

        * WikiPageProvider interface changed: putPageText() now takes a
        WikiPage as an extra argument.

        * RCSFileProvider can now save and retrieve author info as well.

        * Anchor types (i.e. hyperlinks) now have classes so that you can
        redecorate them in the CSS files.  See the CSS files for more
        info.

        * DTD caused Mozilla to slip into standards-compliant mode.  Fixed
        top-margins in jspwiki_ie.css.

        * Added document type declarations to all JSP files.

2001-11-02  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * This is R3, v1.5.0

        * Rewrote README.

        * The distribution archive now contains a separate archive for all
        sample wiki pages to help you bootstrap your own Wiki.

        * Added JSPWikiTips page to the sample wiki pages collection.

        * Removed the authentication scheme from web.xml - out-of-box
        JSPWiki now allows access to anyone.

        * Default, out-of-the-box Page Provider is now
        FileSystemProvider.  This should make building your first Wiki a
        bit simpler.

        * Added file commands to jspwiki.properties.  Also, removed
        references to my own email address - I kept getting plenty of
        automatic email from people trying to set up their own Wiki :-).

        * Removed index.html and rewrote web.xml to automatically grab all
        directory accesses to Wiki.jsp.

        * We now use pageContext.forward() to go to the PageModified.jsp
        when a concurrent modification occurs, instead of using redirect.
        Thanks to Chris Brooking for this hint.

        * Slight cosmetical changes in jspwiki_ns.css

        * Added comments around Javascript code in cssinclude.js to better
        live with old browsers.

2001-11-01  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * Bumped version to 1.4.3-cvs.

        * There is now a sample entry in jspwiki.properties demonstrating
        how to make a direct link to the page editor by using InterWiki
        linking.  [Edit:Main] redirects you to the page where you can edit
        the Main page.

        * LeftMenu.jsp now reads its contents dynamically from a Wiki page
        called "LeftMenu".  Thanks to Mikael Honkala for this idea.

2001-10-30  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * Bumped version to 1.4.2-cvs.

        * Wiki.jsp changed with respect to handling of old page versions.
        It no longer displays the "edit current version".

        * TextFormattingRules now has plenty of more explanations.

        * Added support for arbitrary letters in WikiNames.  Now it's
        possible to use any character set.

        * Added support for links within a document ("footnotes").  Use
        [#1] to create a footnote and [1] to link to it.

        * Empty links no longer generate a hyperlink.

        * FileSystemProvider and RCSFileProvider now know how to handle
        WikiNames that contain illegal characters.  At the moment they use
        simply the java.net.URLEncoder class to make the conversion.

        * Added wrap="virtual" to Edit.jsp textarea element to make it
        also wrap on NS4.

2001-10-25  Erik Bunn  <Erik.Bunn@nospam.memecry.net>

        * Added the capability to view older versions of a WikiPage. 
        The functionality is accessed from PageInfo.jsp. Wiki.jsp
        is affected, as well, and WikiEngine.java has new methods
        (but no actual new functionality).        

2001-10-21  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * This is R2 - v1.4.0.

        * Rewrote the included sample pages.

2001-10-20  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * build.xml can now generate javadocs to docs/javadoc.

        * Edit.jsp now has explains headings, too (thanks Matti).

        * Changed the versioning so that whenever you check out a CVS
        copy, you get vX.Y.Z-cvs as the version string.  This was done to
        separate the development version from the actual release version.

        * Added the list of image inline link patterns to SystemInfo.jsp.

2001-10-18  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.3.3 - not released.

        * You can now have multiline list items if you prepend each
        additional line with a space.

        * Added the ability to specify multiple patterns determining which
        images are inlined and which are not.  See jspwiki.properties for
        more information.

2001-10-16  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * All external links ending with .png are now inlined as images.
        This is an experiment to see if it actually works.  Don't expect
        it to last.

        * Page names can now contain _ and . as well.

        * Added some cosmetical changes to the JSP pages.

2001-10-06  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * Release v1.3.1 - first official release.

        * Clarified build system.

        * All files should now contain copyright.

        * Added plenty of javadoc commentary.

2001-10-02  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * Bold and italic information is now carried across line and
        paragraph breaks.

2001-09-30  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * Added cssinclude.js and three browser-dependent stylesheet
        files.  Also, all jsp files now include the cssinclude.js.

2001-08-25  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * Removed a debug statement, some cosmetical changes.

        * v1.3.0

        * Added jspwiki.applicationName property, and support into
        WikiEngine.

        * Added SystemInfo.jsp

        * Added interWiki functionality.  Now you can define links in
        'jspwiki.properties' where a link of the form [WikiXX:PageName]
        should point to.

2001-08-13  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.2.0

        * WikiEngine now behaves much better if a provider cannot be
        instantiated.

        * Added rudimentary support for version history in a multitude of
        places.

2001-08-13  Janne Jalkanen  <jalkanen@nospam.kosh.ecyrd.com>

        * Wiki.jsp displayed null date if page did not exist.

2001-07-23  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * v1.1.2

        * Search engine interface is now cleaner.

        * Separated actual Wiki page serving from the WikiEngine and hid
        it under the WikiPageProvider interface.

2001-07-20  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * Realm name is now "JSPWiki editor" instead of "Basic
        Authentication Area" or whatever stupid it was.

2001-07-19  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * Conversion of {{ is now fixed - it no longer transforms {{{ into
        {<TT> in certain cases.  Also, multiple {{{s are now handled
        gracefully.

        * v1.1.1

2001-07-18  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * Added a Search box to the header of each page.

        * HTML entities are now replaced correctly in PageModified.jsp to
        prevent arbitrary HTML tags.

        * Added support for <TT> tag with {{text}}.

2001-07-16  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * Couldn't edit new pages, oops.

2001-07-15    <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.regex.fi>

        * Added rudimentary page locking.

2001-07-14  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * Appearance of the jsp pages is now slightly more convergent.

        * Improved search engine to accept exclusion/inclusion a la
        Google.  Scoring now works, too.

        * Added ordered lists (#).

        * Horizontal ruler is now four dashes instead of three to comply
        with the Wiki standard.

2001-07-13  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * Added jspwiki.specialPage.XXX redirection.  You can now name
        special pages that get referred to whichever JSP page you want.
        For example, you can always refer to RecentChanges.jsp in your
        Wiki code by using [RecentChanges], with the following property
        set: 
        
        jspwiki.specialPage.RecentChanges = RecentChanges.jsp

        * v1.0.5

2001-07-10  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * Removed SkipHTMLIterator because it was a bad idea.  No
        InterCapped hyperlinks are available.

        * Fixed tests so that they now actually run.  This required a new
        constructor for WikiEngine.

2001-07-09  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * TranslatorWriter.cleanLink() now removes all non-letters and
        non-numbers from the link name so that you can use all sorts of
        punctuation inside a link name.

        * Implemented RecentChanges list by writing RecentChanges.jsp.
        Wiki.jsp also redirects all requests to a page called
        'RecentChanges' to RecentChanges.jsp.

2001-07-06  Janne Jalkanen  <Janne.Jalkanen@nospam.ecyrd.com>

        * Added configuration at etc/jspwiki.properties.

        * Added this file.
