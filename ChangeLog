       * 2.10.0-svn-22

       * Updated some dependencies and plugins based on results from mvn versions:display-[plugin|dependency]-updates (see base pom.xml)

       * Various Sonar fixes (if cases without braces, trailing-line comments, etc.)

       * Moved filter file (back) from jspwiki-war/src/test/filters to src/main/filters as I
         realized filtering is used in the webapp/WEB-INF folder in the main branch.

       * 2.10.0-svn-21

       * Some Sonar fixes on trailing comments

       * Combined our two maven-war-plugin definitions in jspwiki-war, added a Maven 3 requirement to the base POM
         so we can run mvn versions:display-[plugin|dependency]-updates
       
       * Tightened up SearchManagerTest, now deleting page created after each test (was failing on Jenkins although
         for some reason still working fine on my computer).

       * Fixed the 160-170 Sonar complaints about redundant methods/variables redundantly being 
         declared "public" or "public static final" within interfaces, also removed unused imports.
         Pre-commit we're at 77.5% rules compliance (ranked 69 of 87 Apache projects).

       * 2.10.0-svn-17
       
       * Moved jspwiki.tld to releases/META-INF/ so it becomes part of the JSPWiki JAR instead of 
         standalone file
 
       * Upgraded jspwiki.tld from JSP 1.1 to JSP 2.1 (requires Tomcat 6 or higher), new URL for taglib 
         includes "incubator" but can be quickly changed should JSPWiki become TLP.

2013-06-23  Glen Mazza (gmazza AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.10.0-svn-11

       * Switched jslint checking from yuicompressor-maven-plugin to jslint-maven-plugin 
         (former uses out-of-date jslint version from 2010, and latter allows more customization
         options)

       * 2.9.2-incubating-12
       
       * Removed Cobertura and Sonar tasks from Ant build

         the Ant script; "ant dist" will now use the javadoc generated

         still present in MVN3_BRANCH; that can be moved over as part
         of the move to submodules.

         prior to running any of the Ant tasks, in
         order to download the necessary libs.

       * Added maven-eclipse-plugin to pom.xml to create necessary
         Eclipse .project/.settings/.classpath settings upon calling

       * Switched to a hardcoded jdbc.properties file for testing to simplify build.xml and future

       * 2.9.1-svn-16

               + consider using PluginContent.executeParse(WikiContext) instead
           - WikiPlugin newWikiPlugin( String pluginName, ResourceBundle rb ) is now public and part 
             of the org.apache.wiki.api.engine.PluginManager API

       * 2.9.1-svn-15

       * new API package org.apache.wiki.api.engine, intended to hold WikiEngine, its managers and
         related classes. FilterManager and PluginManager moved there (cfr. JSPWIKI-155, JSPWIKI-303
         and $SVN/trunk/doc/2.10-API.txt).
       
       * org.apache.wiki.FileUtil and org.apache.wiki.TextUtil Moved to equivalent classes under 
         org.apache.wiki.util. Original classes marked with @Deprecated and forwarding to the new 
         ones until 2.10
 
       * deprecated WikiEngine.getRequiredProperty( props, key ) in favour of

         as part of JSPWiki API (cfr. JSPWIKI-303).
       
       * Corrected the displayed version of commons-httpclient, we are downloading 3.1, but it was 
         named 3.0.1 (it is needed to either delete commons-httpclient-3.0.1.jar or run ant 
         clean-deps to ensure that the old jar goes away)
       
       * Some minor refactors to expose generified collections at Acl and AclEntry, and adding 
         missing serialVersionUID at org.apache.wiki.workflow

2012-12-30  Harry Metske <metskem@apache.org>

       * 2.9.1-svn-9

       * repaired broken webtests, we now have one (documented) failing webtest (RenameProfile
         for container managed auth).
         Required fixes:
           - TestContainer now binds the jdbc/UserDatabase jdbc/GroupDatabase in Jetty's namespace
           - Logout webtest checks for the specific JSPWikiAssertedName cookie
           - build.xml was missing a lot of tasks and macros, required to properly startup hsqldb (don't know how/why)
           - JDBCGroupDatabase : NamingExceptions do not have a cause, we now log the exception itself
           - removed the semicolon from the License in .ddl files (they cause syntax errors)

         clean is made
