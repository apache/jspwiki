2015-08-16  Dirk Frederickx (brushed AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.10.2-svn-32  Haddock Template updates & WYSIWYG editing
       
       Haddock Template:

       * [JSPWIKI-902] Printing improvements for the HADDOCK template,
         hiding sidebar, userbox, wrapping long page-names, and a few other tweaks.

       * The Page Footer now sticks to the bottom of the screen, even for short pages

       * Fixed an issue with the persistence of the status of collapsible lists

       * Added fixes for IE compatibility for the bootstrap css framework.

       * [JSPWIKI-892] Haddock editor should put the cursor at the top of the textarea,
         also when opening the editor with a certain section

       * Improved the header layout (suggestion of Harry) moving the quick search field
         into the searchbox dropdown.

       * [JSPWIKI-908] The basic editor toolbar icons (bold, italic, link, etc..)
         are back in the plain editor of HADDOCK.


       WYSIWYG further enhancements

       * (experimental) Included a plain vanilla wysiwyg editor to JSPWiki.
         This editor is based on mooEditable, MIT licensed.
         This editor is unfortunately not compatible with the default template.

         You can still add your own wysiwyg editor to JSPWiki -- hooks are provided
         for TinyMCE and CKeditor.
         
       * Added ajax-based live-preview for wysiwyg editors to the Haddock Template.
         When editing in wysiwyg mode, you now get immediately a preview of the wiki markup.
         (similar to the live-preview mode of the plain editor)

       * The wysiwyg editors are now resizable, just like the plain editor..

         - remove unnecessary scrollbars
         - attempt to resolve the broken icon-fonts on IE11

       * %%add-css style fix to handle special html entities

2015-08-02  Dirk Frederickx (brushed AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.10.2-svn-29

       Some more Haddock template "tweaks":

       * Hide the attach & info navigation menu's for non-existing page

       * Improved the Info dropdown when no Author page exists.

       * Section titles remain visible, even with a sticky navigation menu.
         Eg. when clicking a table of contents entry, you should end up
         with a visible section header just below the sticky menu line.

       * Fixed: the top border of a TABLE was gone.

       * Added a version check on the user-preference cookie to be more robust ico changes.
         (hopefully no more cookie clean-up is needed when upgrading JSPWiki)

       * Sidebar:
         - The sidebar height now extends till the bottom of the page
         - 3 Sidebar modes are now working: left(default), right and hidden

       * Fixed the <wiki:Link> tag to support "cssClass" as attribute. 

       * [JSPWIKI-430] All confirmation dialogs are now build with regular DOM elements. 
         (check out the Log-out or Delete confirmation dialogs to see the improvement) 
  
  
       WYSIWYG editors:

       * Added support for the WYSIWYG editor TinyMCE.jsp

       * Improved server side handling of HtmlStringToWiki translation

       * [JSPWIKI-622] Added an editor selection switch to the editor toolbar. 
         It is now possible to switch between editors (plain, or other installed 
         wysiwyg editors) while in Edit. (no need to go first via the Preferences screen)



2015-07-26  Dirk Frederickx (brushed AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.10.2-svn-28

       Haddock Template commit of the remaining JSP's: UI for handling groups,
       workflow UI, and refactored JSP's for Login/Lostpw/Register.
       This concludes the re-design of all the haddock template JSP's.
       
       Other changes:

       * Fixed page redirections and improved the back button handling.
         Eg. Attachment DELETE will get you now back to the ATTACH view, 
         not the INFO view.  See also [JSPWIKI-867]

       * Tabs & Accordion toggles can now include other markup, rather than only text. 

       * Added CSS3-based automatic text hyphenation for browsers who support this.
         (also works with none justified text)

       * Attachment Upload UI improved: attachment types are represented by icons 
         from the icon-font.

       * Attachment Info page to access version information on attachments
         should now be more user-friendly, with an extra INFO action button.
         (iso a hidden link via the version number)



2015-07-16  Dirk Frederickx (brushed AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.10.2-svn-27

       More Haddock Template tweaks:
       
       * Removed annoying scroll-bars from the dropdown menu's which appeared in some browsers

       * Improved rendering of inserted dropdown's like the MoreMenu and HomeMenu, 
         to make them better fit with bootstrap dropdown menu's.

       * Few fixes of the layout of the UserPreferences menu, and some refactoring
         of the UserPreferences.jsp and the Login.jsp. 
       
       * Fixed an editor bug causing the Live Preview to slow down after some time.

       WYSIWYG editor in JSPWiki

       * Refreshed the WYSIWIG editor with the latest stable version of the 
         CKeditor v4.5.1. (replacement of FCK) Standard version, with BootstrapCK4 skin.
         The update was done for both for the default and the Haddock template.
         FFS: server side translation from wiki-markup to HTML needs more work. 
         ( WysiwygEditingRenderer.getString() often crashes )

2015-07-12  Dirk Frederickx (brushed AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.10.2-svn-25
       
       * [JSPWIKI-896] Haddock template – user preferences are not saved.
         haddock-pref.js was not properly included into the build, due to lowercase 
         issue in wro-haddock.xml.
         
       * [JSPWIKI-518] Saving after editing a section will return you to that  section.
         Fixed missing commits on wiki.js. Should work now.
        
       * Fixed issue with Accesskey
       
       * [JSPWIKI-433] Allow back button for TAB keys.
         It is now also possible to click a link to a hidden pane of a tabbed section
         (eg from the Table Of Contents) to automatically open that TAB pane.

       * Added a "title" attribute to the pagename in the header.  In case a very long 
         pagename is truncated (with ellipsis ...) you can still see the full 
         pagename when you hover the mouse over the pagename.

         The HADDOCK template has refresh mechanism based on "change events". 
         (no periodic refreshes, like the default template)

         reducing the debounce period (read - refresh time-out) to 1sec.

         your mouse to it. Removed the space between the menu and the dropdown.

       * JSPWIKI-887 Slimbox image style for embedded images fixed to show 
         readable link description even in case of missing *title* or *alt* attributes.

       This is the third major check-in of the HADDOCK template, with mainly

       (group related JSPs still to be done) 

       Summary of main changes:

       * Many Suggestion dialogs are added to the plain editor:
         links, link-options, images, acls, plugins, variables, %%styles, 
         hexadecimal colors, fonts, symbols, %%icons, ...

       * Fixed [JSPWIKI-482] Wrong insert from the suggestion box 
       
       * The editor toolbar is simplified, as most functions are reachable via the
         suggestion dialogs. The find & replace UI can be repositioned on the screen.
       
       * Sticky menu bar, which stays on top of the screen when scrolling down.
       
       * The Quick Navigation menu is redesigned to improve usability for creating
         and cloning new pages.

       * New %%styles added:  %%dropcaps, %%flip, %%flop, %%addcss, %%progress,

       * Show READER view (also great for printing) has been added to the More menu.

       * 2.10.1-svn-10  
       
       This is the second major check-in of the HADDOCK template, with 
       fixes and improvements mainly related to the plain editor.

       * Livepreview has been fixed, with ajax based on the fly page rendering. 
         The livepreview area can now also be displayed side-by-side next to the editor textarea, 
         so you can immediately see the rendered wiki-markup during edit.

       * Suggestion dialog boxes are shown while you type to assist entrance of more advanced 
         wiki-markup such as links, %%styles, colors, fonts, plugins, and symbols.
         (but still heavily under development)

       * Section Editing has been improved: you can choose which part of the page you want to edit.

       * All icons are now based on an icon Font, replacing the FamFamFam icon set. 
         Based on Font Awesome by Dave Gandy - http://fontawesome.iohttp://fontawesome.io/icons/

       * The find & replace UI has been enhanced, showing number of occurrences, 
         supporting regular expressions, and supporting replacement for the first or all matches.

       * Text is automatically indented based on the indentation level of the previous line.

       * Using the TAB key inside the textarea will indent a line. Use shift+TAB to un-indent.
         Indentation also works when selecting multiple lines.

       * You can use shift+Enter to quickly insert line-breaks. (\\)


       Fixing following editor related JIRA tickets :
       
       * [JSPWIKI-382]  Remove posteditor.js
      
       * [JSPWIKI-482]  Wrong insert from the suggestion box  

       * [JSPWIKI-443]  Full screen editor. 
         Added a collapsible sidebar, and a side-by-side display of the live-preview area.

       * [JSPWIKI-336]  section selection box not working properly. Fixed. 

       * Fixed the User-Preference page-unload event. 
       

       Other changes : 

       * New "layout" user-preference to switch between fluid or fixed-width page layout.
 
       * Added a info drop-down menu with a summary of the page-info. 
         This is similar to page-footer section, but now accessible at the top of the page.
          
       * Replacing all *.png based icons by an icon font.  (eg. slimbox, filter, rss-feed )

       * Fixing bug when saving the Preferences (detected by Harry)
       
       * Changed fixed-width layout into fluid layout, occupying all screen real-estate.
         (this could become a user-preference setting in the future)  
         Slightly decreasing the size of the sidebar.

              [{RPCSamplePlugin

              test
              }]

		 We are still getting error-code: 490, "No permission to access this AJAX method!"
         when invoking a plugin generated json-rpc call.
       

2014-02-14  Dirk Frederickx (brushed AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.10.1-svn-5

         Introducing the HADDOCK template, a new template/ui for Apache JSPWiki.
         
         This template contains various UI improvements and JSP simplifications, 
         a major redesign of the JSPWiki CSS stylesheet based on BOOTSTRAP 
         (now modularly build with LESS) and a rework of the javascript routines 
         based on mootools v1.4.x. (also the js is now split into modular class files)
 
         Be aware: this is a first commit -- expect things to be broken.
         More work is needed on the plain editor; the Group UI is to be fixed.
         Validation has been done against Safari, Chrome & FF;  IE testing is left
         to the adventurous user. 

         HADDOCK lives peacefully next to the default template. To activate the new 
         template, add following line to your jspwiki-custom.properties:

              jspwiki.templateDir = haddock
         

       * [JSPWIKI-504] New default look for 3.0
       
       * [JSPWIKI-431] Attachment Upload, support upload of multiple files, drag&drop, 
              improved progress bars. 
              However the server functionality to upload multiple files is
              currently broken. FFS
               
       * [JSPWIKI-432] Simplify Tabbed Section Markup 
              Still maintaining backwards compatibility with the current %%tabbedSection
              markup.

       * [JSPWIKI-712] Entites in ChangeNote should be decoded with "keep editing"

       * [JSPWIKI-797] Refactoring the JSPWiki javascript routines, upgrade js libs:
               mootools-core-1.4.5
               mootools-more-1.4.0.1
               prettify (dd. 4 mar 2013)

       * [JSPWIKI-798] Refactoring the JSPWiki main CSS stylesheet - 
               now based on the BOOTSTRAP CSS Framework

       * [JSPWIKI-430] DOM based popups to replace regular js alert or prompt dialog boxes
               Also the edit/clone UI has been refactored. 
               Some delete confirmation dialog boxes are still to be converted. 

       * [JSPWIKI-429] Improved SLIMBOX to support Youtube, flash and other formats.
                You can now also 'slimbox' another wiki-page or an external url.
                Based on this media viewer, also a %%carousel style has been added.

       * [JSPWIKI-478] Remember cookies of collapsible for all contexts
                Collapsible lists and boxes have been refactored, and styled with BOOTSTRAP.
                In general, all %%dynamic-styles are re-styled with BOOTSTRAP css components.

       * [JSPWIKI-693] style issues

       * [JSPWIKI-463] display error in default template
       
       * [JSPWIKI-449] Menuhide functionality is illogical
                The sidebar (aka Favorites) can be shown/hidden via a toggle button.
                By default, the sidebar is hidden in the Edit/Comment view, to give
                maximum square-meters to the edit text-area.
                
       * [JSPWIKI-512] CSS Error with Firefox 2.0.20
                
       *  Upgrade wro4j to latest version 1.7.3

2014-01-07  Harry Metske (metskem@apache.org)

       * 2.10.0-svn-67

       * PropertyReader was using context.log for its logging. Every user changing his prefs is causing
         6 lines of logging to stdout which is cumbersome to get rid of. Changing this to log4j logging
         and offering a way to use an external log4j.properties file so PropertyReader can use log4j
         right away. (The cascaded property reading mechanism does not support "suppressing" properties
         from the ini/jspwiki.properties, only overriding)

2014-01-07  Harry Metske (metskem@apache.org)

       * 2.10.0-svn-58 (I think)

       * Moved MassiveRepositoryTest to surefire plugin exclusion test to speed
         up build.

       * Moved wro4j-maven-plugin from compile to prepare-package phase so
         people can run mvn test, mvn test -Dtest=xxxxTest, etc. without needing
         to trigger wro4j each time.  (A nice sanity saver.)

       * Simpler error messages when JDBC*DatabaseTest fail due to DB being
         unavailable.

2013-08-24  Glen Mazza (gmazza AT apache DOT org)

       * No revision number (IT tests change only)

       * jspwiki-it-test-container-jdbc test now working, so all five IT test submodules are working 
         (except for RenameProfile which fails with all tests).

       * renamed the two "container" tests to more descriptive "cma" (container-managed authentication).
        
2013-08-22  Glen Mazza (gmazza AT apache DOT org)

       * No revision number (IT tests change only)

       * For IT tests switched to Brian Matthew's inmemdb-maven-plugin used by Roller, creates an in-memory
         HSQLDB database with a lifespan that of the IT tests themselves (so no Ant tasks and no DB drop 
         scripts needed).

       * jspwiki-it-test-custom-jdbc test now working, only one still not operative is -container-jdbc,
         which is up from 0 to 25 percent working.
        
2013-08-22  Glen Mazza (gmazza AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.10.0-svn-43

       * Changed jspwiki.propertyfile.cascade to jspwiki.custom.cascade to emphasize cascading is done
         on top of new jspwiki-custom.properties file if present, the default properties file only if not
         present.

       * Changed some internal constants from "propertyfile" to "custom" so they more accurately reflect
         their meaning in 2.10.
        
2013-08-17  Glen Mazza (gmazza AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.10.0-svn-42

       * Updated code from using org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver to org.hsqldb.jdbc.JDBCDriver

       * Switched from inaccurate NoRequiredPropertyException to somewhat better WikiSecurityException 
         for database errors in JDBCGroup/UserDatabase (former was giving confusing error messages
         when the underlying problem was just DB-related).

       * More work in IT tests, for JDBC tests to become operative again (not yet finished).

       * Renamed HsqlDbUtils to HsqlDBUtilsIT in it-tests, to fully ensure HsqlDBUtils in jspwiki-war
         isn't being run instead.
        
2013-08-15  Glen Mazza (gmazza AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.10.0-svn-41

       * Removed "incubator" from JSPWiki taglib URI, removed deprecated in 2004 RSSLinkTag

       * Some simplifications to web.xml put in, taking advantage of 2.5 web.xml format.
        
2013-08-15  Glen Mazza (gmazza AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.10.0-svn-40

       * Removed unneeded config files in Selenium IT module, changed its packaging to WAR
         and its parent to the it tests folder.  JDBC tests still inoperative, but others
         working as before.

       * Removed jdbc.properties file in favor of configuring it in jspwiki-custom.properties.

       * jspwiki.policy file in test updated to more recent structure used by the integrated 
         tests module, subsequently removed from latter as it's unneeded there.
        
2013-08-14  Glen Mazza (gmazza AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.10.0-svn-39

       * Cleaned out unused config in IT tests, centralized common config 
         to Selenium IT module's custom properties file.

       * Patches to the three non-JDBC IT tests made so they're now all running 
         except for one test (RenameProfile), two JDBC IT tests still inoperative.

       * Removed config references to long-discontinued "jspwiki.admin.user" value.
        
2013-08-13  Glen Mazza (gmazza AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.10.0-svn-38

       * Updated all the test/*-custom.properties files, removed all non-necessary configuration items

       * Removed no-longer-needed file filtering from the jspwiki WAR pom.
        
2013-08-11  Glen Mazza (gmazza AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.10.0-svn-37

       * Updated it-test's selenium module to use new jspwiki-custom.properties system.  IT tests only
         working 50% presently (same as before though).

       * Removed some values from our jspwiki-custom.properties files where the defaults in jspwiki.properties
         are sufficient.
        
2013-08-09  Glen Mazza (gmazza AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.10.0-svn-36

       * Introducted new jspwiki-custom.properties file, which can be placed in test/resources for JUnit tests
         or externally to the WAR (for Tomcat, $CATALINA_HOME/lib) and will be picked up automatically by 
         JSPWiki.  Only those elements that you're changing from default src/main/resources/ini/jspwiki.properties
         need addition to the custom properties file.  I still need to convert the Selenium tests to the new format.

       * Renamed jspwiki.properties, _rcs.properties, and _vers.properties file with new -custom suffix in src/test/resources
         (can be named anything as JUnit tests hardcode the names).  Removed elements that are the same as those
         in the default jspwiki.properties file.
        
2013-08-08  Glen Mazza (gmazza AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.10.0-svn-35

       * Partial revert of Jetty to v. 8.1.12 so it can still run with the JDK 6 used by Jenkins.
        
2013-08-07  Glen Mazza (gmazza AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.10.0-svn-34find 

       * Upgrade from Jetty used in unit test cases from v. 7.6.7 to v. 9.0.4
        
2013-08-06  Juan Pablo Santos (juanpablo AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.10.0-svn-33

       * JSPWIKI-799: jenkins build fails because of SearchManagerTest. It was reusing the same page directory  
         as other tests, indexing pages created on other tests, depending on the test execution order.
         
       * Use of Lucene 4.4 *Fields on LuceneSearchProvider to instantiate Fields, instead of using deprecated 
         constructor + Field.Index

2013-08-04  Harry Metske (metskem@apache.org)

       * 2.10.0-svn-32

       * first guess in fixing JSPWIKI-799 TestEngine.emptyWorkdir() cleans another directory the the one used by the test ?

2013-08-03  Glen Mazza (gmazza AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.10.0-svn-28

       * Removed unused variables as reported by Sonar, as information is obtainable
         by other means when needed.

       * Removed "incubating" references in pom.xml
        
2013-08-01  Dirk Frederickx (brushed AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.10.0-svn-27

       * JSPWIKI-761 : Implementing the WRO4J ( Web Resource Optimizer for Java ) Build-time solution 
       through the wro4j maven plugin. 
          - replacing YUI-Compressor for JS by UglifyJS (better compression)
          - introducing the LESS CSS preprocessor supporting advanced css authoring capabilities (variables, mixins, ...)
          - merging JS and CSS files to reduce the number of resources needed at page-load.

       You can now build with or without minification of the JS and CSS files to ease development 
       by using -Dminimize = true | false. (ref. mvn_cheat-sheet.txt)  
        
2013-08-01  Juan Pablo Santos (juanpablo AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.10.0-svn-26

2013-07-31  Glen Mazza (gmazza AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.10.0-svn-25

       * Added missing Lucene dependency for testing, changed location of
         userdatabase.xml and groupdatabase.xml to get more of the Selenium
         tests running.
         
2013-07-30  Glen Mazza (gmazza AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.10.0-svn-24

       * 2.10.0-svn-22

       * Updated some dependencies and plugins based on results from mvn versions:display-[plugin|dependency]-updates (see base pom.xml)

       * Various Sonar fixes (if cases without braces, trailing-line comments, etc.)

       * Moved filter file (back) from jspwiki-war/src/test/filters to src/main/filters as I
         realized filtering is used in the webapp/WEB-INF folder in the main branch.

2013-07-18  Glen Mazza (gmazza AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.10.0-svn-21

       * Some Sonar fixes on trailing comments

       * Combined our two maven-war-plugin definitions in jspwiki-war, added a Maven 3 requirement to the base POM
         so we can run mvn versions:display-[plugin|dependency]-updates
       
       * Tightened up SearchManagerTest, now deleting page created after each test (was failing on Jenkins although
         for some reason still working fine on my computer).

2013-07-18  Glen Mazza (gmazza AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.10.0-svn-20

         Pre-commit we're at 77.5% rules compliance (ranked 69 of 87 Apache projects).
 
       * Moved POM dependency scope declarations out of root pom and into jspwiki-war pom.

2013-07-11  Glen Mazza (gmazza AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.10.0-svn-17
       
       * Moved jspwiki.tld to releases/META-INF/ so it becomes part of the JSPWiki JAR instead of 
         standalone file
 
       * Upgraded jspwiki.tld from JSP 1.1 to JSP 2.1 (requires Tomcat 6 or higher), new URL for taglib 
         includes "incubator" but can be quickly changed should JSPWiki become TLP.

2013-07-11  Glen Mazza (gmazza AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.10.0-svn-16
       
       * Upgraded JSTL to 1.2 (which includes standard, so could remove that dependency)
      
       * Removed jstl-fmt.tld, oscache.tld in favor of versions within their respective JARs

2013-07-03  Juan Pablo Santos (juanpablo AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.10.0-svn-15

         warning messages in the build.

2013-06-23  Glen Mazza (gmazza AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.10.0-svn-11

       * Switched jslint checking from yuicompressor-maven-plugin to jslint-maven-plugin 
         (former uses out-of-date jslint version from 2010, and latter allows more customization
         options)

       * Updated google-code-prettify's JS to latest 2013 version.

2013-06-11  Harry Metske (metskem@apache.org)

       * JSPWIKI-770: added jspwiki-it-test-container and jspwiki-it-test-container-jdbc
         selenium maven execution. Still some bits of refactor remaining + the IT

         of mvn clean. 

       * Selenium tests folder moved to 
         src/test/config; deleted now-unused tests folder.

2013-05-23  Glen Mazza (gmazza AT apache DOT org)

       * Adjusted exclusions in Apache Rat, nonvital
         i18n stuff removed from build.xml, HSQLDB now
         writing temp files to target instead of base
         directory (easier to remove that way).

2013-05-23  Glen Mazza (gmazza AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.9.2-incubating-12
       
       * Removed Cobertura and Sonar tasks from Ant build
         and placed into Maven project (relying on config

         the Ant webtests and dist targets run fine with
         the results from mvn clean install.

2013-05-22  Glen Mazza (gmazza AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.9.2-incubating-9

       * Moved the javadoc and Rat plugins from MVN3_BRANCH to 
         trunk and removed corresponding javadoc and rat code from
         the Ant script; "ant dist" will now use the javadoc generated
         from Maven.  Note additional configuration for javadoc plugin 
         still present in MVN3_BRANCH; that can be moved over as part
         of the move to submodules.

       * 2.9.2-incubating-6
       
       * Moved to one source of record for JSPWiki's 
         dependencies (the Maven pom.xml file), it will
         now be needed to run "mvn clean install [-Dmaven.test.skip]"
         prior to running any of the Ant tasks, in
         order to download the necessary libs.

       * Added maven-eclipse-plugin to pom.xml to create necessary
         Eclipse .project/.settings/.classpath settings upon calling
         mvn eclipse:clean eclipse:eclipse and removed corresponding
         folders in SVN repository. (IDEA users use mvn idea:idea
         instead.)

       * 2.9.2-incubating-5
       
       * Mavenized location of doc directory; rat, javadoc,

         wishing to use different table/column names.

2013-05-16  Glen Mazza (gmazza AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.9.2-incubating-0
       
       * Mavenized location of jdbc.properties.tmpl, routed JDBC tests 
         from tests/etc/db to target/etc/db, removed unused Ant API-difference
         detector & switched to Maven Clirr plugin equivalent.

2013-05-06  Glen Mazza (gmazza AT apache DOT org)

2013-05-02 Glen Mazza (gmazza AT apache DOT org)

       * Removed install.sh, build.sh/build.bat/build.properties.win, moved latter's
         info into build.properties.

       * slight renaming of web.xml files generated in build.xml for readability

       * Added Maven-only filters.properties to src/main/filters (not yet used)

       * 2.9.1-incubating-7

       * Moved WAR resources from previous commit to correct src/main/webapps/WEB-INF location, fixed pom.xml

         named 3.0.1 (it is needed to either delete commons-httpclient-3.0.1.jar or run ant 
         clean-deps to ensure that the old jar goes away)
       
       * Some minor refactors to expose generified collections at Acl and AclEntry, and adding 
         missing serialVersionUID at org.apache.wiki.workflow

       * repaired broken webtests, we now have one (documented) failing webtest (RenameProfile
         for container managed auth).
         Required fixes:
           - TestContainer now binds the jdbc/UserDatabase jdbc/GroupDatabase in Jetty's namespace
           - Logout webtest checks for the specific JSPWikiAssertedName cookie
           - build.xml was missing a lot of tasks and macros, required to properly startup hsqldb (don't know how/why)
           - JDBCGroupDatabase : NamingExceptions do not have a cause, we now log the exception itself
           - removed the semicolon from the License in .ddl files (they cause syntax errors)
