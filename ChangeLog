       * 2.10.0-svn-68
       
       * Minor nit in jspwiki.css resulted in overly-tall popup menus on Preferences page. Spotted by Ichiro Furusato.
       
2014-01-07  Harry Metske (metskem@apache.org)

       * 2.10.0-svn-67

       * PropertyReader was using context.log for its logging. Every user changing his prefs is causing
         6 lines of logging to stdout which is cumbersome to get rid of. Changing this to log4j logging
         and offering a way to use an external log4j.properties file so PropertyReader can use log4j
         right away. (The cascaded property reading mechanism does not support "suppressing" properties
         from the ini/jspwiki.properties, only overriding)

2014-01-07  Harry Metske (metskem@apache.org)

2013-12-31  Juan Pablo Santos (juanpablo AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.10.0-svn-63
       
       * Special page reference RecentChanges giving a blank page (due to non-existent JSP) instead  
         of required WikiPage.
       
2013-12-30  Juan Pablo Santos (juanpablo AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.10.0-svn-62
       
       * JSPWIKI-809: PageCache has hardcoded limit of 1000 and doesn't fail gracefully
       
       * Attachment servlet would perform unsafe redirection on doGet if a nextpage param was provided 
         (JSPWIKI-46 related)

2013-12-28  Harry Metske (metskem@apache.org)

       * 2.10.0-svn-61

2013-12-22  Glen Mazza (gmazza AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.10.0-svn-58 (I think)

       * Moved MassiveRepositoryTest to surefire plugin exclusion test to speed
         up build.

       * Moved wro4j-maven-plugin from compile to prepare-package phase so
         people can run mvn test, mvn test -Dtest=xxxxTest, etc. without needing
         to trigger wro4j each time.  (A nice sanity saver.)

       * Simpler error messages when JDBC*DatabaseTest fail due to DB being
         unavailable.

       * 2.10.0-svn-54
       
       * retaking JSPWIKI-155, extracted interface o.a.w.api.engine.AdminBeanManager, cfr. with  
         $SVN/jspwiki-war/src/main/config/2.10-API.txt for details
         
2013-12-04  Juan Pablo Santos (juanpablo AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.10.0-svn-53
       
       * some more refactorings before moving into JSPWIKI-155, cfr. with 
         $SVN/jspwiki-war/src/main/config/2.10-API.txt for details

       * 2.10.0-svn-52
       
       * second wave of removing deprecated classes / methods, cfr. with

2013-12-02  Juan Pablo Santos (juanpablo AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.10.0-svn-51
       
       * first wave of removing deprecated classes / methods, cfr. with 
         $SVN/jspwiki-war/src/main/config/2.10-API.txt for details
         
       * Brought back Installer.INSTALL_WARNING constant, got lost somewhere in time and was still 
         being used by Install.jsp
       
2013-12-01  Juan Pablo Santos (juanpablo AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.10.0-svn-50

       * Broke cycle between o.a.w.parser and o.a.w.api.engine packages:
       ** added public Pattern getPluginPattern() to o.a.w.api.engine.PluginManager
       ** moved PluginContent parsePluginLine( WikiContext context, String commandline, int pos ) from 
          o.a.w.api.engine.PluginManager to equivalent-static method on o.a.w.parser.PluginContent
       ** deleted deprecated public static boolean isPluginLink( String link ) from o.a.w.api.engine.PluginManager,

       * Lucene upgraded to 4.6, minor upgrades on plugin versions

2013-11-25  Harry Metske (metskem@apache.org)

       * 2.10.0-svn-47

       * fixed JSPWIKI-803 Too strict version requirement on plain editor, maxVersion set to 2.9

2013-09-28  Harry Metske (metskem@apache.org)

       * 2.10.0-svn-46

       * fixed JSPWIKI-792 additional fix, ehcaches now have unlimited expiry (RecentChanges were not showing all entries)

2013-09-15  Glen Mazza (gmazza AT apache DOT org)

       * Removed jspwiki-site under jspwiki-trunk, now just one source of record
         for the website (jspwiki/site)

2013-09-03  Harry Metske (metskem@apache.org)

       * 2.10.0-svn-45

       * Added jspwiki.login.throttling (default true, as in Java code) to default jspwiki.properties
       
       * Removed unnecessary config from IT test's jspwiki-custom.properties.
        
2013-08-24  Glen Mazza (gmazza AT apache DOT org)

       * No revision number (IT tests change only)

       * jspwiki-it-test-container-jdbc test now working, so all five IT test submodules are working 
         (except for RenameProfile which fails with all tests).

       * renamed the two "container" tests to more descriptive "cma" (container-managed authentication).
        
2013-08-22  Glen Mazza (gmazza AT apache DOT org)

       * No revision number (IT tests change only)

       * For IT tests switched to Brian Matthew's inmemdb-maven-plugin used by Roller, creates an in-memory
         HSQLDB database with a lifespan that of the IT tests themselves (so no Ant tasks and no DB drop 
         scripts needed).

       * jspwiki-it-test-custom-jdbc test now working, only one still not operative is -container-jdbc,
         which is up from 0 to 25 percent working.
        
2013-08-22  Glen Mazza (gmazza AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.10.0-svn-43

       * Changed jspwiki.propertyfile.cascade to jspwiki.custom.cascade to emphasize cascading is done
         on top of new jspwiki-custom.properties file if present, the default properties file only if not
         present.

       * Changed some internal constants from "propertyfile" to "custom" so they more accurately reflect
         their meaning in 2.10.
        
2013-08-17  Glen Mazza (gmazza AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.10.0-svn-42

       * Updated code from using org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver to org.hsqldb.jdbc.JDBCDriver

       * Switched from inaccurate NoRequiredPropertyException to somewhat better WikiSecurityException 
         for database errors in JDBCGroup/UserDatabase (former was giving confusing error messages
         when the underlying problem was just DB-related).

       * More work in IT tests, for JDBC tests to become operative again (not yet finished).

       * Renamed HsqlDbUtils to HsqlDBUtilsIT in it-tests, to fully ensure HsqlDBUtils in jspwiki-war
         isn't being run instead.
        
2013-08-15  Glen Mazza (gmazza AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.10.0-svn-41

       * Removed "incubator" from JSPWiki taglib URI, removed deprecated in 2004 RSSLinkTag

       * Some simplifications to web.xml put in, taking advantage of 2.5 web.xml format.
        
2013-08-15  Glen Mazza (gmazza AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.10.0-svn-40

       * Removed unneeded config files in Selenium IT module, changed its packaging to WAR
         and its parent to the it tests folder.  JDBC tests still inoperative, but others
         working as before.

       * Removed jdbc.properties file in favor of configuring it in jspwiki-custom.properties.

       * jspwiki.policy file in test updated to more recent structure used by the integrated 
         tests module, subsequently removed from latter as it's unneeded there.
        
2013-08-14  Glen Mazza (gmazza AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.10.0-svn-39

       * Cleaned out unused config in IT tests, centralized common config 
         to Selenium IT module's custom properties file.

       * Patches to the three non-JDBC IT tests made so they're now all running 
         except for one test (RenameProfile), two JDBC IT tests still inoperative.

       * Removed config references to long-discontinued "jspwiki.admin.user" value.
        
2013-08-13  Glen Mazza (gmazza AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.10.0-svn-38

       * Updated all the test/*-custom.properties files, removed all non-necessary configuration items

       * Removed no-longer-needed file filtering from the jspwiki WAR pom.
        
2013-08-11  Glen Mazza (gmazza AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.10.0-svn-37

       * Updated it-test's selenium module to use new jspwiki-custom.properties system.  IT tests only
         working 50% presently (same as before though).

       * Removed some values from our jspwiki-custom.properties files where the defaults in jspwiki.properties
         are sufficient.
        
2013-08-09  Glen Mazza (gmazza AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.10.0-svn-36

       * Introducted new jspwiki-custom.properties file, which can be placed in test/resources for JUnit tests
         or externally to the WAR (for Tomcat, $CATALINA_HOME/lib) and will be picked up automatically by 
         JSPWiki.  Only those elements that you're changing from default src/main/resources/ini/jspwiki.properties
         need addition to the custom properties file.  I still need to convert the Selenium tests to the new format.

       * Renamed jspwiki.properties, _rcs.properties, and _vers.properties file with new -custom suffix in src/test/resources
         (can be named anything as JUnit tests hardcode the names).  Removed elements that are the same as those
         in the default jspwiki.properties file.
        
2013-08-08  Glen Mazza (gmazza AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.10.0-svn-35

       * Partial revert of Jetty to v. 8.1.12 so it can still run with the JDK 6 used by Jenkins.
        
2013-08-07  Glen Mazza (gmazza AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.10.0-svn-34find 

       * Upgrade from Jetty used in unit test cases from v. 7.6.7 to v. 9.0.4
        
2013-08-06  Juan Pablo Santos (juanpablo AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.10.0-svn-33

       * JSPWIKI-799: jenkins build fails because of SearchManagerTest. It was reusing the same page directory  
         as other tests, indexing pages created on other tests, depending on the test execution order.
         
       * Use of Lucene 4.4 *Fields on LuceneSearchProvider to instantiate Fields, instead of using deprecated 
         constructor + Field.Index

2013-08-04  Harry Metske (metskem@apache.org)

       * 2.10.0-svn-32

       * first guess in fixing JSPWIKI-799 TestEngine.emptyWorkdir() cleans another directory the the one used by the test ?

2013-08-03  Harry Metske (metskem@apache.org)

       * 2.10.0-svn-31

       * refixed JSPWIKI-791 NoClassDefFoundError for org.apache.lucene.analysis.standard.ClassicAnalyzer

2013-08-03  Glen Mazza (gmazza AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.10.0-svn-28

       * Removed unused variables as reported by Sonar, as information is obtainable
         by other means when needed.

       * Removed "incubating" references in pom.xml
        
2013-08-01  Dirk Frederickx (brushed AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.10.0-svn-27

       * JSPWIKI-761 : Implementing the WRO4J ( Web Resource Optimizer for Java ) Build-time solution 
       through the wro4j maven plugin. 
          - replacing YUI-Compressor for JS by UglifyJS (better compression)
          - introducing the LESS CSS preprocessor supporting advanced css authoring capabilities (variables, mixins, ...)
          - merging JS and CSS files to reduce the number of resources needed at page-load.

       You can now build with or without minification of the JS and CSS files to ease development 
       by using -Dminimize = true | false. (ref. mvn_cheat-sheet.txt)  
        
2013-08-01  Juan Pablo Santos (juanpablo AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.10.0-svn-26

       * Removed org.apache.wiki.WikiException in favour of org.apache.wiki.api.exceptions.WikiException
         
2013-07-31  Glen Mazza (gmazza AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.10.0-svn-25

       * Added missing Lucene dependency for testing, changed location of
         userdatabase.xml and groupdatabase.xml to get more of the Selenium
         tests running.
         
2013-07-30  Glen Mazza (gmazza AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.10.0-svn-24

       * JSPWIKI-791: Upgrade Lucene from 3.6.0 to 4.4.0       

2013-07-28  Harry Metske (metskem@apache.org)

       * 2.10.0-svn-23

       * fixed JSPWIKI-784 UTF-8 chars not correctly rendered if served by JBoss
          (JBoss now also uses response.getOutputStream)

2013-07-19  Glen Mazza (gmazza AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.10.0-svn-22

       * Updated some dependencies and plugins based on results from mvn versions:display-[plugin|dependency]-updates (see base pom.xml)

       * Various Sonar fixes (if cases without braces, trailing-line comments, etc.)

       * Moved filter file (back) from jspwiki-war/src/test/filters to src/main/filters as I
         realized filtering is used in the webapp/WEB-INF folder in the main branch.

2013-07-18  Glen Mazza (gmazza AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.10.0-svn-21

       * Some Sonar fixes on trailing comments

       * Combined our two maven-war-plugin definitions in jspwiki-war, added a Maven 3 requirement to the base POM
         so we can run mvn versions:display-[plugin|dependency]-updates
       
       * Tightened up SearchManagerTest, now deleting page created after each test (was failing on Jenkins although
         for some reason still working fine on my computer).

2013-07-18  Glen Mazza (gmazza AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.10.0-svn-20

       * Some Sonar fixes on minor matters.
       
2013-07-15  Glen Mazza (gmazza AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.10.0-svn-19

       * Some Sonar complaints removed regarding redundant final declarations within

2013-07-14  Glen Mazza (gmazza AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.10.0-svn-18
       
       * Fixed the 160-170 Sonar complaints about redundant methods/variables redundantly being 
         declared "public" or "public static final" within interfaces, also removed unused imports.
         Pre-commit we're at 77.5% rules compliance (ranked 69 of 87 Apache projects).
 
       * Moved POM dependency scope declarations out of root pom and into jspwiki-war pom.

2013-07-11  Glen Mazza (gmazza AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.10.0-svn-17
       
       * Moved jspwiki.tld to releases/META-INF/ so it becomes part of the JSPWiki JAR instead of 
         standalone file
 
       * Upgraded jspwiki.tld from JSP 1.1 to JSP 2.1 (requires Tomcat 6 or higher), new URL for taglib 
         includes "incubator" but can be quickly changed should JSPWiki become TLP.

2013-07-11  Glen Mazza (gmazza AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.10.0-svn-16
       
       * Upgraded JSTL to 1.2 (which includes standard, so could remove that dependency)
      
       * Removed jstl-fmt.tld, oscache.tld in favor of versions within their respective JARs

2013-07-03  Juan Pablo Santos (juanpablo AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.10.0-svn-15

         is the only place using it.

       * Updated some licenses to most recent.

2013-07-01  Glen Mazza (gmazza AT apache DOT org)

       * 2.10.0-svn-13

       * 2.10.0-svn-12

       * Switched to Jaxen 1.1.4 and removed nonstandard *-exclusion to get rid
         of "jaxen:jaxen:jar with value '*' does not match a valid id pattern"
         warning messages in the build.

       * Global use of org.apache.wiki.api.exceptions.WikiException instead of org.apache.wiki.WikiException, 
         as part of JSPWiki API (cfr. JSPWIKI-303).
       
       * Corrected the displayed version of commons-httpclient, we are downloading 3.1, but it was 
         named 3.0.1 (it is needed to either delete commons-httpclient-3.0.1.jar or run ant 
         clean-deps to ensure that the old jar goes away)
       
       * Some minor refactors to expose generified collections at Acl and AclEntry, and adding 
         missing serialVersionUID at org.apache.wiki.workflow

2012-12-30  Harry Metske <metskem@apache.org>

       * 2.9.1-svn-9

       * repaired broken webtests, we now have one (documented) failing webtest (RenameProfile
         for container managed auth).
         Required fixes:
           - TestContainer now binds the jdbc/UserDatabase jdbc/GroupDatabase in Jetty's namespace
           - Logout webtest checks for the specific JSPWikiAssertedName cookie
           - build.xml was missing a lot of tasks and macros, required to properly startup hsqldb (don't know how/why)
           - JDBCGroupDatabase : NamingExceptions do not have a cause, we now log the exception itself
           - removed the semicolon from the License in .ddl files (they cause syntax errors)

2012-12-26  Harry Metske <metskem@apache.org>

         the maintenance of a libraries' svn directory.

         clean is made
