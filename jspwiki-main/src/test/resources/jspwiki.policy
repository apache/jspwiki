// This file contains the local security policy for JSPWiki.
// It provides the permissions rules for the JSPWiki
// environment, and should be suitable for most purposes.
// JSPWiki will load this policy when the wiki webapp starts.
//
// As noted, this is the 'local' policy for this instance of JSPWiki.
// You can also use the standard Java 2 security policy mechanisms
// to create a consolidated 'global policy' (JVM-wide) that will be checked first,
// before this local policy. This is ideal for situations in which you are
// running multiple instances of JSPWiki in your web container.
// To set a global security policy for all running instances of JSPWiki,
// you will need to specify the location of the global policy by setting the
// JVM system property 'java.security.policy' in the command line script
// you use to start your web container. See the documentation
// pages at http://doc.jspwiki.org/2.4/wiki/InstallingJSPWiki. If you
// don't know what this means, don't worry about it.
//
// Also, if you are running JSPWiki with a security policy, you will probably
// want to copy the contents of the file jspwiki-container.policy into your
// container's policy. See that file for more details.
//
// ------ EVERYTHING THAT FOLLOWS IS THE 'LOCAL' POLICY FOR YOUR WIKI ------

// The first policy block grants privileges that all users need, regardless of
// the roles or groups they belong to. Everyone can register with the wiki and
// log in. Everyone can edit their profile after they authenticate.
// Everyone can also view all wiki pages unless otherwise protected by an ACL.
// If that seems too loose for your needs, you can restrict page-viewing
// privileges by moving the PagePermission 'view' grant to one of the other blocks.

grant principal org.apache.wiki.auth.authorize.Role "All" {
    permission org.apache.wiki.auth.permissions.PagePermission "*:*", "view";
    permission org.apache.wiki.auth.permissions.WikiPermission "*", "editPreferences";
    permission org.apache.wiki.auth.permissions.WikiPermission "*", "editProfile";
    permission org.apache.wiki.auth.permissions.WikiPermission "*", "login";
};


// The second policy block is extremely loose, and unsuited for public-facing wikis.
// Anonymous users are allowed to create, edit and comment on all pages.
//
// Note: For Internet-facing wikis, you are strongly advised to remove the
// lines containing the "modify" and "createPages" permissions; this will make
// the wiki read-only for anonymous users.

// Note that "modify" implies *both* "edit" and "upload", so if you wish to
// allow editing only, then replace "modify" with "edit".

grant principal org.apache.wiki.auth.authorize.Role "Anonymous" {
    permission org.apache.wiki.auth.permissions.PagePermission "*:*", "edit";
    permission org.apache.wiki.auth.permissions.WikiPermission "*", "createPages";
};


// This next policy block is also pretty loose. It allows users who claim to
// be someone (via their cookie) to create, edit and comment on all pages,
// as well as upload files.
// They can also view the membership list of groups.

grant principal org.apache.wiki.auth.authorize.Role "Asserted" {
    permission org.apache.wiki.auth.permissions.PagePermission "*:*", "edit";

    permission org.apache.wiki.auth.permissions.GroupPermission "*:*", "view";
};


// Authenticated users can do most things: view, create, edit and
// comment on all pages; upload files to existing ones; create and edit
// wiki groups; and rename existing pages. Authenticated users can also
// edit groups they are members of.

grant principal org.apache.wiki.auth.authorize.Role "Authenticated" {
    permission org.apache.wiki.auth.permissions.PagePermission "*:*", "modify,rename";
    permission org.apache.wiki.auth.permissions.GroupPermission "*:*", "view";
    permission org.apache.wiki.auth.permissions.GroupPermission "*:<groupmember>", "edit";
    permission org.apache.wiki.auth.permissions.WikiPermission "*", "createPages,createGroups";
};


// Administrators (principals or roles possessing AllPermission)
// are allowed to delete any page, and can edit, rename and delete
// groups. You should match the permission target (here, 'JSPWiki')
// with the value of the 'jspwiki.applicationName' property in
// jspwiki.properties. Two administative groups are set up below:
// the wiki group "Admin" (stored by default in wiki page GroupAdmin)
// and the container role "Admin" (managed by the web container).

grant principal org.apache.wiki.auth.GroupPrincipal "Admin" {
    permission org.apache.wiki.auth.permissions.AllPermission "*";
};
grant principal org.apache.wiki.auth.authorize.Role "Admin" {
