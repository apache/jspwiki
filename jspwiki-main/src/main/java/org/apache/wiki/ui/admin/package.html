Contains classes for the JSPWiki administrative interface.

<h2>Package specification</h2>

<p>Since JSPWiki 2.6, a new administration interface has been added under /admin/Admin.jsp.  This
interface is based on AdminBeans, a particular kind of bean which is used by JSPWiki to
generate a HTML interface.</p>

<p>The AdminBeans can also be JMX beans, which means that it is possible to control them
from a regular management application.  However, instead of just using a constructed HTML
user interface, the AdminBeans may have full control over the HTML they emit.</p>
