/**
 * <p>
 * AbstractStep subclass that asks an actor Principal to choose an Outcome on behalf of an owner (also a Principal). The actor
 * "makes the decision" by calling the {@link #decide(Outcome, Context)} method. When this method is called, it will set the Decision's Outcome to
 * the one supplied. If the parent Workflow is in the {@link Workflow#WAITING} state, it will be re-started. Any checked WikiExceptions
 * thrown by the workflow after re-start will be re-thrown to callers.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * When a Decision completes, its {@link #isCompleted()} method returns <code>true</code>. It also tells its parent WorkflowManager to
 * remove it from the list of pending tasks by calling {@link DecisionQueue#remove(Decision)}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To enable actors to choose an appropriate Outcome, Decisions can store arbitrary key-value pairs called "facts." These facts can be
 * presented by the user interface to show details the actor needs to know about. Facts are added by calling classes to the Decision,
 * in order of expected presentation, by the {@link #addFact(Fact)} method. They can be retrieved, in order, via {@link #getFacts()}.
 * </p>
