# Install.jsp
install.jsp.title=JSPWiki Installer
install.jsp.intro.title=JSPWiki Installer
install.jsp.intro.p1=Welcome\!  This page is to help you with the first stage of JSPWiki installation.  If you're seeing this page, you already have JSPWiki running in your container.
install.jsp.intro.p2=There are now some things that you should configure.  When you press the Configure button below, we will generate a \
                     <code>jspwiki-custom.properties</code> file for you.
install.jsp.intro.p3=This setup system is really meant for people who just want to be up and running really quickly. \
                     If you want to integrate JSPWiki with an existing system, I would recommend that you go and edit \
                     a <code>jspwiki-custom.properties</code> file directly and put that somewhere on the classpath.  You can find a \
                     sample config file at <a href="https://jspwiki-wiki.apache.org/Wiki.jsp?page=Documentation"> our wiki </a>.
install.jsp.install.info=Good news:
install.jsp.install.warning=Warning:
install.jsp.install.error=Could not save configuration:
install.jsp.install.msg.rnd.pwd=Because no administrator account exists yet, JSPWiki created one for you, with a \
                                random password. You can change this password later, of course. The account''s id is \
                                {0} and the password is {1}. Please write this information down and keep it in a \
                                safe place. JSPWiki also created a wiki group called {2} that contains this user.
install.jsp.install.msg.admin.notexists=Is this the first time you've run the Installer? If it is, you should know that after JSPWiki validates and saves your configuration for the first time, you will need administrative privileges to access this page again. We do this to prevent random people on the Internet from doing bad things to your wiki.

install.jsp.basics.title=Basics
install.jsp.basics.appname.label=Application Name
install.jsp.basics.appname.desc=What should your wiki be called?  Try to use a relative short name.

install.jsp.basics.baseurl.desc=At what URL do you want to your wiki located (fully qualified) ?
install.jsp.basics.page.storage.label=Page storage
install.jsp.basics.page.storage.desc=By default, JSPWiki will use the VersioningFileProvider that stores files in a \
                                     directory. If you specify a directory that does not exist, JSPWiki will \
                                     try to create it for you. All attachments will also be put in the same directory.

install.jsp.security.title=Security

install.jsp.security.sec.conf.opt1=JAAS plus container security (default)
install.jsp.security.sec.conf.opt2=Container security only

                                   It will also respect any container security constraints you might have, \
                                   if you've enabled them in your <code>web.xml</code> file. If you disable JAAS security, \
                                   JSPWiki might not work as you expect. But sometimes you might want to do this if you're \
                                   trying to troubleshoot.

                                             all members of the Admin group the all-powerful <code>AllPermission</code>.
