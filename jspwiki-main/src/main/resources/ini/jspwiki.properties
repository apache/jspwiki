#  This is the JSPWiki configuration file.  You'll need to edit this
#  a bit.  The first few lines are the most important ones.
#
#  If you don't want to edit this file, you can override each individual
#  property by specifying the property name as a standard
#  Java System Property.
#
#  Wherever it is said that an option can be "true" or "false", you can
#  also use "yes"/"no", or "on/off".  Just for some convenience.
#
#
#  You can use this to override the default application name.  It affects
#  the HTML titles and logging, for example.  It can be different from
#  the actual web name (http://my.com/mywiki) of the application, but usually
#  it is the same.
#
jspwiki.applicationName = JSPWiki

#
#  Which page provider class to use.  Possibilities are:
#
#    FileSystemProvider     - for simple pure file storage with no version information
#    VersioningFileProvider - for simple pure file storage with    version information
#
jspwiki.pageProvider = FileSystemProvider

#
# How to order pages in various lists and plugins.  By default, they are
# ordered using Java's "natural" String order (purely character by character
# comparison). This means that the pages named "Page1", "Page2" and "Page10"
# appear in the order "Page1", "Page10", "Page2".
#
# To specify a different ordering, give the fully qualified name of a String
# Comparator. If the class can't be found, an error will be logged and page
# sorting will fall back to the default "natural" ordering. You can specify
# any String Comparator class here BUT be careful of using case insensitive
# comparators as JSPWiki page names may be case sensitive.
# Example: jspwiki.pageNameComparator.class = my.fully.qualified.comparator
#
# For convenience, we have provided a few possibly useful comparators:
#
# HumanComparator understands numbers and sorts in a more human friendly
# order (English only).  Using HumanComparator, the pages "Page1", "Page2",
# "Page10" will sort in that order.
# Example: jspwiki.pageNameComparator.class = HumanComparator
#
# LocaleComparator uses the server's Locale for ordering.  Useful if your
# content is always in a language other than English.  Does not do human
# friendly numeric ordering.
# Example: jspwiki.pageNameComparator.class = LocaleComparator
#
#jspwiki.pageNameComparator.class =

#
#  Set to true, if you want to cache page data into memory.  This is
#  in general a good idea.
#
#  Default is false (no cache).
#
#  NB: This replaces the JSPWiki 1.x "CachingProvider" setting, since it
#      probably was too confusing.
#
jspwiki.usePageCache = true

#
#  Determines where wiki files are kept for FileSystemProvider i.e.:
#
#  jspwiki.fileSystemProvider.pageDir = /p/web/www-data/jspwiki/
#
#  If you're using Windows, then you must duplicate the backslashes.
#  For example, use:
#
#  jspwiki.fileSystemProvider.pageDir = C:\\Data\\jspwiki
#
#  If not provided, will default to a "jspwiki-files" directory
#  in the user's home folder.
#


#
#  The JSPWiki working directory.  If not set, a temporary path will
#  be used.  You can see the location of the workdir in the logs.
#  It is HIGHLY recommended that you set this.
#
#  The working directory is used to cache things like Lucene search
#  results.
#
#jspwiki.workDir =

#
#  ATTACHMENTS:
#
#  Use the following property to define which attachment provider
#  you want to use.  You have basically two choices:
#    * Set the value to BasicAttachmentProvider
#      a simple, flat file versioning provider
#    * Leave the value empty (or just comment the line out)
#      the attachment functionality is disabled
#
jspwiki.attachmentProvider = BasicAttachmentProvider

#
#  The BasicAttachmentProvider needs to know where to store the files
#  the user has uploaded.  It's okay to put these in the same directory
#  as you put your text files (i.e. the pageDir setting above).
#
#  If you're using Windows, then you must duplicate the backslashes.
#  For example, use:
#
#  jspwiki.basicAttachmentProvider.storageDir = C:\\Data\\jspwiki
#
#  If not provided, will default to a "jspwiki-files" directory
#  in the user's home folder.
#

#
#  You can tell the BasicAttachmentProvider to add a flag
#  so that browsers do not cache certain (or all) attachment
#  types. This is useful in intranet environments. You should activate
#  this if your users complain that their excel files are not uploaded
#  correctly and they still do have an old version: Usually the
#  file was uploaded correctly, but they get the locally cached version
#
#  You can use regular expressions to disable the cache, e.g the
#  following example will disable browser cache for all excel and word files
#
#  If you don't define this property, cache is enabled by default for
#  all attachments
#
#  jspwiki.basicAttachmentProvider.disableCache = .*\.xls|.*\.doc

#
#  You can limit the maximum size of an attachment by setting this
#  value.  The value is in bytes, and by default all attachments
#  are accepted.
# This limit is not enforced for users with AdminPermissions.
#
#  The following line would limit the attachment size to 100,000 bytes
#jspwiki.attachment.maxsize=100000

#
#  By default JSPWiki accepts all types of attachments.  However, you
#  can allow some types only, or forbid some other types.  By default,
#  all file types are allowed (if you do not specify the "allow" list
#  at all or it is empty).
# These allow/forbid statements are not enforced for users with AdminPermissions.
#
#  These both are space-separated lists of file suffixes
#
#  Example: Allow only PNG, JPG, ZIP and JAR file attachments
#jspwiki.attachment.allowed=.png .jpg .zip .jar

#  Example: Forbid HTML, PHP, ASP and EXE
#jspwiki.attachment.forbidden=.html .htm .php .asp .exe

# Example: Attachment links to HTML, HTM and MP3 files would force a download rather then opening the attachment
#jspwiki.attachment.forceDownload= .html .htm

#
#  page Diff Representation
#
#  To show differences between page versions, you can define a
# difference provider.
#  The following choices are available:
#    * TraditionalDiffProvider - Uses internal (java) diff
#        to create a list of changes and shows it line by
#        line colored. This is the default
#    * ContextualDiffProvider - Uses internal (java) diff
#        to create changes inline and shows it on a word by
#        word basis using CSS. This is much superior to the
#        traditional diff provider, however, it is still quite
#        new and not much tested. YMMV.
#    * ExternalDiffProvider - uses a system diff program (which
#        can be configured using "jspwiki.diffCommand") to
#        create an unified (!) diff.
#
#        Example for a diff command:
#        jspwiki.diffCommand = /usr/bin/diff -u %s1 %s2
#
jspwiki.diffProvider = TraditionalDiffProvider

#
#  Determines which character encoding JSPWiki should use.  If you want
#  to support all languages in your Wiki, you probably want to enable
#  this.  From JSPWiki 2.2, it is strongly suggested that you use UTF-8.
#
#  Note that you can't switch these in the mean time, since the way the
#  files are encoded on disk is incompatible between ISO-Latin1 and UTF-8.
#  Don't try.  You'll get all sorts of interesting problems, if you do.
#
#  Possible values are 'ISO-8859-1' (default, if none has been specified)
#  and 'UTF-8'.

jspwiki.encoding = UTF-8

#
# The following 3 properties apply sensible constraints around custom page
# properties that can be saved into the AbstractFileProvider. These default
# values were chosen with future JDBC providers in mind.
# See: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/JSPWIKI-856
#
#custom.pageproperty.max.allowed=200
#custom.pageproperty.key.length=255
#custom.pageproperty.value.length=4096


#
#  Determines whether raw HTML is allowed as Wiki input.
#
#  THIS IS A DANGEROUS OPTION!
#
#  If you decide to allow raw HTML, understand that ANY person who has
#  access to your Wiki site can embed ANY sort of malicious JavaScript,
#  or plugin, or ActiveX, or whatever on your site.  They can even mess it
#  up so royally it is impossible for you to replace the situation without
#  the need of direct access to the repository.  So think twice before
#  allowing raw HTML on your own site.
#
#  Most probably you want to use this on Intranets, or personal servers,
#  where only a handful of people can access the wiki.
#
#  Text between {{{ and }}} -options is not affected by this setting, so
#  it's always safe to quote HTML code with those.
#
#  The default for this option is "false".
#
jspwiki.translatorReader.allowHTML = false

#  Usability niceties.
#
#
#  If this property is set to "true", then page titles are rendered
#  using an extra space between every capital letter.  It may make
#  page titles readable on some occasions, but it does have the
#  drawback of making the titles look a bit funny at times.
#
jspwiki.breakTitleWithSpaces = false

#
#  If set to true, this property means that "WikiName" and "WikiNames"
#  are considered equal when linking between them.  Setting this to
#  true does not prevent you from having both kinds of pages - we just
#  fall back to the other one if the primary name does not exist.
#
#  For any other language, you'll probably want to turn this off.
#
jspwiki.translatorReader.matchEnglishPlurals = true

#
#  If you set this to true, the Wiki translator will then also consider
#  "traditional" WikiNames (that is, names of pages JustSmashedTogether
#  without square brackets) as hyperlinks.  This technique is also
#  known as "CamelCase", or "BumpyCase", or "InterCapping".  I personally
#  like CamelCase as a word, which is why this property is named as it is :-).
#
#  By default this is false, since traditional WikiLinks may confuse newbies.
#
#  This option can be overridden on a per-page basis using the SET directive.
#
jspwiki.translatorReader.camelCaseLinks = false

#
#  This sets the default template used by the Wiki engine.  The templates
#  live in templates/<template name>.  JSPWiki will attempt to find three
#  basic templates from that directory: "ViewTemplate," "EditTemplate"
#  and "AdminTemplate"
#
#  The "haddock" template has now become the default. You can switch to 2.9/2.10 default
#  template by setting this value to "210"
#
#  This option can be overridden on a per-page basis using the SET directive.
#
#jspwiki.templateDir = default


#
#  The name of the front page.  This is the page that gets loaded if no
#  other page is loaded.  Up until JSPWiki 1.9.28, it was always called
#  "Main", but now you can easily change the default front page here.  If not
#  defined, uses "Main".
#
#jspwiki.frontPage = Main

#
#  Allow creation of empty pages. Defaults to false.
#
#jspwiki.allowCreationOfEmptyPages = false

#
#  If set to true, all outward links have a small icon attached.  The icon
#  can be found from images/out.png.  Default is true.
#
jspwiki.translatorReader.useOutlinkImage = true

#
#  Set this to the number of minutes a person can "lock" a page
#  for while he is editing it.

jspwiki.lockExpiryTime = 60

#
#  Search provider used for searching pages and attachments.
#  Default is LuceneSearchProvider, but you can fall back to BasicSearchProvider
#
jspwiki.searchProvider = LuceneSearchProvider

#
#  If your wiki's language is something else than English, you might
#  want to visit lucene.apache.org and download a proper Analyzer

#
# jspwiki.specialPage.OriginalWiki = http://c2.com/cgi/wiki

#
#  Plugin search paths.
#
#  Define here the packages you want to use for searching plugins,
#  separated with commas.
#  For example, use the following command to add "org.myorganisation.jspwiki.myplugins"
#  and "com.foobar.myplugins" to the search path.
#
#  jspwiki.plugin.searchPath = org.myorganisation.jspwiki.myplugins,com.foobar.myplugins
#
#  The default path is "org.apache.wiki.plugin", and it will be always
#  the last item on the path.  This allows you to override JSPWiki default
#  plugins.  Note that you are only adding to the path, not replacing it (ie.
#  the default path is never removed.)
#
#  If the path is not specified (and there is no jspwiki_module.xml with the
#  plugin JAR), you need to either declare the search path by hand, or
#  use a fully qualified name.
#
#  If you are a plugin developer, please consider deploying a jspwiki_module.xml
#  file with your plugin JAR, so that the user does not have to set the searchPath.
#
#  jspwiki.plugin.searchPath = org.myorganisation.jspwiki.myplugins,com.foobar.myplugins
#
jspwiki.plugin.searchPath =

# You can specify external jars containing plugin classes. These will be added to the classpath

#  Page filters

#
#  URL Constructor
#
#  JSPWiki by default generates page and attachment links that use JSP
#  pages and request parameters. It can also use alternative URL
#  constructors so that URL pages resemble traditional website paths, too.
#  You have three choices for generating URLs:
#
#     DefaultURLConstructor - uses JSPs for all references:
#         http://mywiki.com/jspwiki/Wiki.jsp?page=Main
#         http://mywiki.com/jspwiki/Edit.jsp?page=Main
#
#     ShortURLConstructor - uses path-like reference style:
#         http://mywiki.com/jspwiki/wiki/Main
#         http://mywiki.com/jspwiki/wiki/Main?do=Edit
#
#     ShortViewURLConstructor - uses path-like references for views; JSPs for everything else:
#         http://mywiki.com/jspwiki/wiki/Main
#         http://mywiki.com/jspwiki/Edit.jsp?page=Main
#
#  Of course, you can also write your own implementation if you wish.
#
#  For either of the ShortURL constructors, you can also specify a
#  prefix path to go in front of page names. By default, the
#  prefix is 'wiki/'.
#
#  Be warned that the ShortURLConstructor does not work well with any other editor
#  except the built-in plaintext one.  Use ShortViewURLConstructor if you plan
#  to enable any other ones.
#
#jspwiki.urlConstructor = DefaultURLConstructor
#jspwiki.urlConstructor = ShortViewURLConstructor
#jspwiki.shortURLConstructor.prefix = wiki/
#  This prefix must be in some elements of web.xml, too: in
#  servlet-mapping of WikiServlet, in filter-mapping of WikiJSPFilter

#############################################################################
#
# Rendering

# At this time, entries here are strictly for development and testing.

# Disable internal caching of pre-constructed document DOMs.

#############################################################################
#
#  Security, authentication and authorization
#

#  JSPWiki supports a plugin-based interface for talking to different
#  kinds of authentication and authorization systems. By "authentication,"
#  we mean a system for logging in a user to establish their identity.
#  By "authorization," we mean a system for figuring out what actions
#  users can perform based on their authenticated identities.
#
#  For users looking to get started quickly, the default settings below
#  should work fine. In addition to the properties below, you may also
#  want to modify the security policy file WEB-INF/jspwiki.policy. See
#  the policy file for more details.
#
#  AUTHENTICATION
#
#  For authentication, JSPWiki uses JAAS (Java Authentication and Authorization
#  Service) in combination with a servlet filter that picks up any credentials
#  set by the servlet container. The Authentication system is configured below.
#
#  You must choose either (A) Container or (B) Custom authentication. (B) is the default.
#
#  A) CONTAINER AUTHENTICATION
#  JSPWiki will always (passively) collect credentials supplied by your servlet
#  container, via HttpServletRequest.getUserPrincipal/getRemote user. You do not
#  need to do anything to enable this. In addition, you can cause JSPWiki users
#  to log in to the web container by uncommenting the the <security-constraint>
#  elements in WEB-INF/web.xml.
#
#  B) CUSTOM AUTHENTICATION
#  If you do not wish to use container-managed authentication, you can use JSPWiki's
#  own custom authentication system. This uses a JAAS LoginModule (supplied below)
#  to log in the user. You can use any JAAS LoginModule you want.
#  The default class is org.apache.wiki.auth.login.UserDatabaseLoginModule,
#  which compares the supplied username and hashed password with the values stored
#  in the configured UserDatabase (see USER DATABASE below).
#
#  Supply the JAAS LoginModule class used for custom authentication here.
#  The implementation MUST have a zero-argument constructor (as noted in the
#  javax.security.auth.spi.LoginModule Javadocs).
jspwiki.loginModule.class = org.apache.wiki.auth.login.UserDatabaseLoginModule

#
# JAAS LoginContext parameters used to initialize the LoginModule. Note that 'param1'
#  etc. should be replaced with the actual parameter names. The parameter names and
# values will be loaded to a Map and passed to the LoginModule as the 'options' parameter
# when its initialize() method is called. The default UserDatabaseLoginModule class does
# not need any options.
#jspwiki.loginModule.options.param1 = value1
#jspwiki.loginModule.options.param2 = value2

#
# Login Throttling - Whether logins should be throttled to limit bruce-force attempts.
#
jspwiki.login.throttling=true

#
#  Cookie authentication & assertion
#
#  If this value is set to "true", then JSPWiki will allow you to "assert" an
#  identity using a cookie.  It's still considered to be unsafe, just like no
#  login at all, but it is useful when you have no need to force everyone to login.
#
#  By default, this is on.
#
#jspwiki.cookieAssertions=true

#
#  If you would like to keep your users logged in for weeks at a time, you can
#  turn on "cookie authentication" feature.  However, this comes with important
#  security caveats:
#  1) User will stay logged in into your system for weeks.  This means that if
#     someone manages to nab the cookie during this time, they can pretend to
#     be that user.
#  2) The mappings between cookies and users are written in your filesystem,
#     in $jspwiki.workDir/logincookies.  Access to this directory means that
#     the ability to fake anyone in the wiki, so please make sure that only
#     the proper admin has read access to this directory.
#
#  By default, cookie authentication is off.
#
#jspwiki.cookieAuthentication=false

#
#  Defines how many days the cookies are kept, and how often the people have to log in.
#  The default is two weeks, i.e. 14 days.  If you need a shorter period than one day,
#  turn off cookie authentication, then tweak your web.xml to allow for longer sessions.
#
#jspwiki.cookieAuthentication.expiry=14

#
#
#  AUTHORIZATION
#
#  For authorization, JSPWiki has a two-tier system. When we want to
#  determine whether a user has permission to perform a certain action,
#  we first consult (A) an external "authorizer" to determine if the user
#  is a member of the required role. In addition to checking its external
#  authorizer, it also checks (B) its GroupManager for wiki-managed groups.
#
#  A) EXTERNAL AUTHORIZATION
#  By default, JSPWiki uses the servlet container's authorization service
#  for to check what roles the user belongs to (that is, it calls
#  HttpServletRequest.isUserInRole(String)). After the user authenticates,
#  the default Authorizer (WebContainerAuthorizer) checks to see if the user
#  belongs to the roles listed in web.xml using <security-role>/<role-name> or
#  <auth-constraint>/<role-name> elements. However, you can use another
#  Authorizer if you wish; specify that class here.

jspwiki.authorizer = org.apache.wiki.auth.authorize.WebContainerAuthorizer

#  B) GROUPS
#  As an additional source of authorization, users can belong to discretionary
#  "wiki groups" that the users manage themselves. Wiki groups are stored in a
#  GroupDatabase. The default group database uses an XML file for persistent
#  storage. Override with your own GroupDatabase implementation with this property:

jspwiki.groupdatabase = org.apache.wiki.auth.authorize.XMLGroupDatabase

#  The default group database implementation stores member lists
#  in an XML file. The location of this file should be in a secure directory
#  in the filesystem; for example, in /etc or your servlet container's
#  configuration directory If you do not supply a value for this property,
#  a blank group database will be initialized in the WEB-INF/ directory of the
#  deployed webapp. Since these directories are often overwritten when webapps
#  are undeployed or redeployed, you should probably set this property to
#  something useful as soon as you can. But for test wikis, it's probably
#  ok to leave this un-set, as long as users know that their groups could
#  "disappear" if the wiki app is ever redeployed.

#jspwiki.xmlGroupDatabaseFile = /etc/tomcat/groupdatabase.xml

#  USER DATABASE
#  User's wiki profiles are stored in a UserDatabase. The default user database
#  uses an XML file for persistent storage.
#  Override with your own UserDatabase implementation with this property:

jspwiki.userdatabase = org.apache.wiki.auth.user.XMLUserDatabase

#  The default user database implementation stores usernames and passwords
#  in an XML file. Passwords are SHA-1 hashed. The location of this file
#  should be in a secure directory in the filesystem; for example, in
#  /etc or your servlet container's configuration directory.
#  If you do not supply a value for this property, a blank user database
#  will be initialized in the WEB-INF/ directory of the deployed webapp.
#  Since these directories are often overwritten when webapps are
#  undeployed or redeployed, you should probably set this property to
#  something useful as soon as you can. But for test wikis, it's probably
#  ok to leave this un-set, as long as users know that their profiles could
#  "disappear" if the wiki app is ever redeployed.

#jspwiki.xmlUserDatabaseFile = /etc/tomcat/userdatabase.xml

# You can also use a JDBC database for storing user profiles,
# to be configured below in the JDBC section. See the online
# AuthenticationAndAuthorization2.3 docs and the JavaDoc for
# the JDBCUserDatabase class for details on how to configure it.
#

#jspwiki.userdatabase = org.apache.wiki.auth.user.JDBCUserDatabase

#  If your JSPWiki user database shares login information with your
#  web container's authentication realm, you can configure JSPWiki to
#  add container users. At present, this only works with JDBCUserDatabase,
#  and only if you've configured your web container to use a database
#  with compatible columns and tables. If you don't know what this means,
#  then leave this property set to FALSE (the default).

#jspwiki.userdatabase.isSharedWithContainer = false

#  ACCESS CONTROL LISTS
#  Last but not least, JSPWiki needs a way of reading and persisting page
#  access control lists. The default implementation reads these from the page
#  markup. For example: "[{ALLOW edit Charlie}]". If using a custom
#  ACL manager, specify the AclManager implementation class here:

jspwiki.aclManager = org.apache.wiki.auth.acl.DefaultAclManager

#
# Define which image types are inlined.
# These are your standard glob expressions (just like in your
# Windows or UNIX shells).  Default pattern is to include all PNG
# images.  If you specify something here, you will override the default.
#
# Don't forget to increase the number after the dot - duplicate entries
# cause problems!
#
# For example:
#   Inline all JPG files, PNG files and all files from images.com:
#
#      jspwiki.translatorReader.inlinePattern.1 = *.jpg
#      jspwiki.translatorReader.inlinePattern.2 = *.png

#  Determine how the RSS (Rich Site Summary) file generation should work.
#  RSS is a standard pioneered by Netscape, which allows you to join your
#  Wiki with a huge number of different news services around the world.
#  Try a Google search on RSS and see what you can do with it.
#
#  All of these settings were added in JSPWiki 1.7.6.

#  JavaMail configuration. If you wish to allow your users to recover
#  their passwords via email, you should configure these properties.
#  JavaMail can use either a container-managed JNDI resource factory
#  (recommended, and the default), or a stand-alone factory whose properties
#  are configured with mail.* properties in this file (below).
#

#  A. Configure the address from which the email appears to come.
#     If you're going to use a mail session obtained via JNDI, this setting
#     will only be used if it hasn't already been configured in the obtained
#     session itself. If you comment it out, JSPWiki will use its internal
#     default value.
#     If you're going to use a stand-alone mail session, you will surely want
#     to configure it, otherwise the internal default value will be used.
#
mail.from = JSPWiki <JSPWiki@localhost>

#  B. JNDI Resource Factory Configuration. JSPWiki will try this first.
#     You will need to configure your container to provide a JavaMail
#     resource factory. See your container documentation, or check our
#     fairly complete documentation (with examples for Tomcat) in
#     the JavaDocs for org.apache.wiki.util.MailUtil.
#
#  JNDI resource name. The commented-out value is the default.
#jspwiki.mail.jndiname = mail/Session

#  C. Stand-alone Resource Factory. JSPWiki will use these values if JNDI fails.
#
#  Your SMTP host (i.e. the one which sends email)
mail.smtp.host = 127.0.0.1

# If for some reason the standard smtp port (25) is blocked, you can change it here
mail.smtp.port = 25

# Set what the user sees in the "from" line of the email
#mail.from = JSPWiki <JSPWiki@localhost>

# If you are using a webserver that is publicly accessible it usually
# doesn't allow you to send mail anonymously
# (because then this mailserver would become an open relay).
# Therefore you can indicate your account information here...
#
#mail.smtp.account =  your.email@email.com
#mail.smtp.password = yourEmailPassword

# The properties below control connection timeouts and TLS (encryption)
# if the mailserver supports it. The commented-out values are the defaults.
#mail.smtp.timeout = 5000
#mail.smtp.connectiontimeout = 5000
#mail.smtp.starttls.enable = true

#
# Workflow configuration
#
# The following properties map specific workflow steps to their associated approvers
# The name of the workflow or decision is the part of the key after "jspwiki.approver.".
# This is a logical name JSPWiki uses to determine which Principal to consult for approval.
# The Principal is identified up by AuthorizationManager at runtime; it looks for a Principal
# match as follows: GroupPrincipals; Roles; WikiPrincipals/other principals. Thus, if a value
# of "Admin" is supplied JSPWiki will first check the GroupManager to see if group Admin exits;
# then the container roles, if any; then, user Principals. If the value is blank or the
# property is commented out, it means that the workflow does not require approval.
#
# EXAMPLE:
# Uncomment the next line to require the Admin group (or Admin user, if a group is not found)
# to approve wiki pages after saving.
#jspwiki.approver.workflow.saveWikiPage=Admin

# Uncomment the next line to require the Admin group to approve new user profiles
