- Preview capability in Edit.jsp

- Pages are now normalized - i.e. they are all saved in the same
  format regardless of the operating system or browser.

- Added new page, "UserPreferences".

- support for images as hyperlinks.

- RSS feed.

UPGRADE NOTES
=============

- If updating manually (from v1.7.0):

  * New JSP pages "Preview.jsp" and "UserPreferences.jsp" must be
    copied.
