This is a beta version of JSPWiki 2.4

NEW FEATURES
============

* Authentication and authorization.

* New default template, with pluggable editors.

* New rendering engine, which is WAY faster than the old one (the old one
  is still included for backwards compatibility purposes).

* Loads and loads of under-the-hood changes.

UPGRADE NOTES
=============

Upgrading from 2.x:

* Please reinstall in a new directory.  Then move your modified
  templates into the new templates/ -directory.  You MUST
  have the default template in place, else things might not
  work.

* Replace jspwiki.properties with your old configuration file.
  It should run unmodified, though you might want to go through
  the new file to see new options.

* You can copy your old filters.xml to WEB-INF/classes

Upgrading from earlier installations:

* Please make a complete reinstall.  Your wiki pages will still be
  compatible, and the configuration for the most part.

KNOWN MAJOR ISSUES
==================

* Documentation needs cleanup; parts of it are out of date, etc.


EXPERIMENTAL FEATURES
=====================

There are some features in this release which could mostly be considered
experimental at best.  The following ones are known to work only 
partially:

* Atom support.  We can give out feeds in Atom 1.0, but it's not really
  tested properly.  There's also preliminary APP support, but it does 
  not work.
  
* WYSIWYG editing.  You need to install FCK by yourself.  It sort of
  works, but not quite.
  
* Install.jsp.  It's still a bit experimental, though it should work...

* WebDAV support.  This is known to be broken on pretty many levels...

* XHTML -> WikiMarkup translation.  Spotty, but should work for the most
  part.
