This is a beta release of JSPWiki.  The documentation is out-of-date,
the code is buggy and you definitely shouldn't run this on a
production server.  Wait for the next stable release.

Major changes since the last stable (1.5.0) release are:

- Author information is saved in the RCS files as well.  If the author
  is not authenticated, then the IP address is saved.

- Document type declarations should now be correct in all JSP files.
  This should have no effect, but some browsers are known to change
  rendering modes (such as Mozilla) so there might be some changes to
  the way things look.

- You can't put Javascript inside links anymore.  Nyah, nyah =).

- PageInfo is no longer in UTC, but the local timezone.

- Full UTF-8 support.  This is settable in the jspwiki.properties.
  Everything should still fall back to ISO-8859-1 if need be.

- new CSS styles

- Environment is now inherited from parent when running RCS commands.
  This should help with some Windows-related problems.

- URL encoding scheme has changed slightly to work around a bug in
  Sun JDKs 1.2 - 1.3.


UPGRADE NOTES
=============

- Most JSP pages have changed again, thanks to new CSS styles and the
  UTF-8 support.  This time the changes have been quite minimal,
  mostly calling WikiEngine.safeGetParameter() instead of
  request.getParameter().

- If you upgrade from your existing ISO-8859-1 -based system to UTF-8,
  note that whenever a page is saved, it is saved as UTF-8.  So
  basically conversion happens whenever someone edits a page.
  However, there is no going back to ISO-8859-1 - this is a one-way
  street!
