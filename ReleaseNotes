This is a beta release of JSPWiki.

Major changes since the last stable (1.6.0) release are:

- Added ReferenceManager. This object is initialized statically by 
  each WikiEngine, and it keeps track of all WikiPage cross references
  within that WE. This is an unoptimized, in-memory solution, at least
  initially: the WE scans through ALL existing WikiPages when it is 
  created, asks the RM to update itself, and thereafter updates the 
  RM every time a page is saved. 

  NOTE: the actual ReferenceManager.java implementation is quick'n'dirty,
  and may still have synchronization problems. Definitely not ready for
  release. The TranslatorReader hook to look for WikiLinks is a nasty
  kludge and should at least be optimized a bit, too.

  NOTE 2: the results returned by the linklist tag are not sorted in any
  way. Alphabetical, or maybe frequency sorting in ReferenceManager,
  might be nice. To do.

- New plugin system:  You can now embed any plugin class that
  implements the com.ecyrd.jspwiki.plugin.WikiPlugin interface onto a
  Wiki page just simply by using the command

  [{INSERT <plugin class> WHERE <param1=value1>,<param2=value2>,...}]

  For example, RecentChanges, UnusedPages, UndefinedPages are all done
  this way.

- new property: jspwiki.baseURL for those cases where you need to
  tunnel your Wiki through a firewall or something, using some sort of
  URL rewriting scheme.


UPGRADE NOTES
=============

- If updating manually:
  - copy all JSP files
  - remove the extra special page entries from jspwiki.properties -
    the only ones you should be left with are "SystemInfo" and "FindPage".
  - Copy the new JSPWiki sample pages (LeftMenuFooter, RecentChanges,
    UndefinedPages, UnusedPages are new) into your wiki page repository.
  - ant build; cp -r build/com .../JSPWiki/WEB-INF/classes/
    OR
    unzip the contents of the WAR file somewhere and copy the classes
    from there (far easier).
