This is a beta release of JSPWiki.

Major changes since the last stable (1.6.0) release are:

- Added ReferenceManager. This object is initialized statically by 
  each WikiEngine, and it keeps track of all WikiPage cross references
  within that WE. This is an unoptimized, in-memory solution, at least
  initially: the WE scans through ALL existing WikiPages when it is 
  created, asks the RM to update itself, and thereafter updates the 
  RM every time a page is saved. 

  RM is queried through a tag library. This is the first tag implemented
  in JSPWiki (mainly because I needed the practice). To list all references
  to a given page, you would include the following tag on your JSP page:

     <jspwiki:linklist action="getref" page="<%=aPageName%>" 
        show="10" linesep="true"/>

  Other actions are "getunref" to search for unreferenced WikiPages, and
  "getmissing" to find referenced, but non-existant pages. You can drop
  the show and linesep parameters, and page only applies to action "getref".

  All JSP pages including LeftMenuFooter or using the tag above need to 
  include the tag library at their beginning: 

          <%@ taglib uri="/WEB-INF/tlds/taglib.tld" prefix="jspwiki" %>

  NOTE: the actual ReferenceManager.java implementation is quick'n'dirty,
  and may still have synchronization problems. Definitely not ready for
  release. The TranslatorReader hook to look for WikiLinks is a nasty
  kludge and should at least be optimized a bit, too.
