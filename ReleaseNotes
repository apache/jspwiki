This is a beta release of JSPWiki.

Major changes since the last stable (1.7.0) release are:

- Preview capability in Edit.jsp

- Pages are now normalized - i.e. they are all saved in the same
  format regardless of the operating system or browser.

- Added new page, "UserPreferences".

- support for images as hyperlinks.

- RSS feed, RSS links and RSS autodiscovery.

- Possibility to match English plurals between Wiki words (WikiName =
  WikiNames, etc) to simplify writing.

- Page titles can now be shown with or without spaces.

- New plugin: CurrentTimePlugin

- No longer needs RCS - has a new provider called
  VersioningFileProvider and uses also an internal diff routine to
  show the changes between versions.  This should be good news to all
  Windows people.


UPGRADE NOTES
=============

- If updating manually (from v1.7.0):

  * New JSP pages "Preview.jsp" and "UserPreferences.jsp" must be
    copied.

  * Nearly all JSP pages have been slightly changed, so you want to
    probably copy them too.  We apologize for the inconvinience, but
    hopefully this is the last time ever.

  * If you've set the "jspwiki.diffCommand", please remove it and
    see if the internal diff routine works for you.

  * Check the RSS feed options in jspwiki.properties.

  * Check also other options in jspwiki.properties.
