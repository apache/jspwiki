<h3>Package Specification</h3>
<p>Provides WikiSyntaxDecorator, an abstract SyntaxDecorator, which takes care of all the plumbing when developing one,
and all the Wiki syntax decoration related classes, so all that it is needed for a custom syntax decorator is:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Provide decorators for all the XHTML elements - just extend the abstract decorators on this package, providing
        only the specific wiki syntax on each case</li>
    <li>Extend WikiSyntaxDecorator and provide the previous implementations of all the needed decorators on the init(...) method</li>
</ul>

<h3>Related Documentation</h3>
See APIDocs for org.apache.wiki.htmltowiki.syntax.jspwiki for an example of how to develop a custom wiki syntax decorator
