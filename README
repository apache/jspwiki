What is it?
-----------

JSPWiki is a simple WikiWiki clone.  It keeps all of its
formatting in JSP files, and uses a custom Java class called
'com.ecyrd.jspwiki.WikiEngine' to all interfacing with the Wiki
system.

(No, the LGPL does not mean that all the content in your new wiki will
be under the LGPL, anymore than any text you write using Emacs becomes
GPL.)

One small request I have.  If you really, really like this software,
donate a small amount of money to the World Wildlife Foundation
(WWF), Free Software Foundation (FSF), or Electronic Freedom
Foundation (EFF), or whichever charity is close to your heart.

The world doesn't need to become a bad place.

Oh yeah, and if you run a Wiki based on this software, let me know.
I'm always interested in hearing from my users =).


Pre-requirements
----------------

Okay, so you wanna Wiki?  You'll need the following things:

REQUIRED:

* A JSP engine that supports Servlet API 2.3.  I recommend Tomcat from
  http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat for a really easy installation.
  Tomcat 4.x or later is supported.

* Some previous administration experience...  If you've ever installed
  Apache or any other web server, you should be pretty well off.

* And of course, a server to run the JSP engine on.

* JDK 1.4+

OPTIONAL:

* JavaMail package from java.sun.com, if you want to use log4j mailing
  capabilities.  You'll also need the Java Activation Framework.

* RCS versioning system installed and available in your PATH if you
  want to use RCS versioning.  It is also possible (and on Windows, it
  is even recommended) to use the VersioningFileProvider, which does
  not require RCS.


Really simple installation
--------------------------

This section is meant for you, if you just want to have a really quick
install without much worries.  If you want to have a more complicated
installation (with more power as to how to do things), 
check out the "Install" section below.

Since JSPWiki 2.1.153, JSPWiki comes with a really simple installation
engine.  Just do the following:

1) Install Tomcat from http://jakarta.apache.org/ (or any other servlet
   container)

2) Drop the JSPWiki.war file in your <tomcat home>/webapps/ directory.
   Optional: Rename the JSPWiki.war if you want your URL to end with
   something else than /JSPWiki/.  For example, to get it called "wiki"
   just rename the "JSPWiki.war" file to "wiki.war".

3) Point your browser at http://<myhost>/JSPWiki/Install.jsp
   (Or, if you renamed it in the previous phase, use something like
   http://<myhost>/wiki/Install.jsp)

4) Answer a couple of simple questions

5) Point your browser to http://<myhost>/JSPWiki/

That's it!


Installation
------------

First, install a JSP engine and a web server.  You can download Tomcat
from http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/.  This software was built
originally on top of Tomcat 4.0, but probably most other versions
work, too, and most other JSP containers.

After you've installed the engine and checked that it works, you just
make a subdirectory under $TOMCAT_HOME/webapps/.  For example, if you
want your application to be called 'MyWiki', just create a directory
called 'MyWiki', then extract all files from the war files into that
directory, preserving the directory structure.

Edit the WEB-INF/jspwiki.properties file to your liking.  The only
thing you need to set is the directory where you want your wiki pages
to be stored.  I recommend a directory that is regularly backed up.

Unzip the contents of jspwiki-samplepages.zip into your newly created
directory.  You can find the rest of the documentation in there.

(Re)start tomcat.

Point your browser at http://<where your Tomcat is installed>/MyWiki/.
You should see the Main Wiki page.  See the next section if you want
to edit the pages =).


Installation with Windows
-------------------------

If you are using a version of Microsoft Windows, you'll find that
getting RCS up and running may be a bit problematic, and thus we
recommend the VersioningFileProvider.

There is some documentation within the samplepages archive, on page
"WindowsInstall".



Upgrading from previous versions
--------------------------------

Please read ReleaseNotes.


Setting access controls
-----------------------

If you don't want everyone to have access to your Wiki, take a look a
the "web.xml" file.  It contains sample configuration for someone who
wants a Wiki that's viewable by all, but editable only be few.  By
default, this is disabled, so your new Wiki is a free-for-all.

Remove the marked comments from web.xml.

Add a user to the "user" role in $TOMCAT_HOME/conf/tomcat-users.xml.
For example:
    <user name="wiki" password="wiki" roles="user" /
adds an user called "wiki" with a password "wiki".

Restart Tomcat.


Configuring JSPWiki
-------------------

All configuration information is kept in WEB_INF/jspwiki.properties.
The file is pretty well documented, so I recommend you read it through
first. 

The other good document to read is doc/Templates.txt, which explains
how the JSPWiki templating system works.


Where to go next aka. where is the rest of the documentation?
-------------------------------------------------------------

With this information, you should've gotten the JSPWiki engine
running.  I now suggest that you extract all of the files in
jspwiki_samplepages.zip into your page repository directory, and start
reading the documentation.  Most of the documentation comes in the
form of Wiki pages, which you can obviously read with a text editor as
well.


Notes:
~~~~~~

Feel free to edit the JSP pages anyway you like.  Just don't touch any
of the Java code, unless you know what you're doing, because otherwise
the Wiki might stop to work.  Most modern HTML editors are smart
enough not to mess with the JSP tags (all the stuff between <% and
%>).

With JSPWiki v2, we have split the functionality from presentation.
Thus you can, and should edit only the pages under templates/.  See
the page WikiTemplates for more information.

While Tomcat is also a fully featured Web server, it is not
particularly fast.  You might also have a web server already running.
Tomcat does integrate itself pretty well with existing web servers,
such as Apache, so you can just see the instructions at
http://jakarta.apache.org/ to see how to get Tomcat and Apache talking
to each other using mod_jk.  (Don't use mod_jserv, it's outdated and
confusing.)

RCS may be a bit troublesome to set up.  I recommend you just run it
without RCS at first, then switch over when you understand how Wiki
works.


Files
-----

Files are kept in a subdirectory, which is defined in the
jspwiki.properties file.  All files are in text format (usually in the
system's native format), with a file ending defined in
WikiEngine.java.  This is ".txt" by default.

There are some default files with the distribution archive.  Feel free
to use them to bootstrap your own Wiki.


Internationalisation
--------------------

JSPWiki can also handle UTF-8. In fact, it's even recommended to use UTF-8
in new installations.  However, you need to switch this at
install-time, since the old method of handling ISO-8859-1 and the new
method of handling UTF-8 are not compatible, and I did not wish to
break previous installations that are already using the ISO-8859-1
charset.

If you're interested, the reason is as follows:  W3C forgot to define
a standard how URLs that are not US-ASCII should be handled.  The Web
de-facto standard is to use ISO-8859-1 (Latin1) and encode it with
(%xy), where xy is the hexadecimal representation.  However, this
means that everyone else in the world can't use this.  So, very
logically, you can also encode UTF-8 in this format.  Unfortunately,
there is NO way to distinguish between these URLs that are really
UTF-8 and those URLs that are ISO-8859-1, since they look exactly the
same.  This is why you must tell JSPWiki which character set to use
to start with.

The FileSystemProvider and RCSFileProvider save the files on the disk
just as if they were URLs.  This can get really messy with Japanese
language page names, for example.  You can always check the URL to the
page, to find how they are named on the disk =).

There are some known issues with UTF-8 support on some older browsers.
Please check
http://www.jspwiki.org/Wiki.jsp?page=JSPWikiBrowserCompatibility
for more information.


Plugins
-------

Since v1.6.3 you can now define your own plugins.  These are just
simply Java classes that implement the
'com.ecyrd.jspwiki.plugin.WikiPlugin' interface and can be found from
somewhere in your class path.  The plugins work so that when you write
a special code on the Wiki page, the plugins are invoked and their
output is inserted into the page, verbatim.

The form is:

  [{INSERT <plugin class> WHERE <param1=value1>,<param2=value2>,...}]

Check out the JSPWikiPlugins page from the JSPWiki distribution for
more information.


Attachments
-----------

Version 2 now brings new attachment functionality.  I recommend
reading the WikiAttachments page.



XML-RPC
-------

JSPWiki comes configured with two XML-RPC interfaces.  The first
interface, which lives by default in <your-wiki-url>/RPC2, is a fully
XML-RPC spec compliant version, whereas the other one, which lives at
<your-wiki-url>/RPCU makes things easier by accepting UTF-8 -format
strings.

You can configure the URLs and other things from the web.xml file.  By
default, the XML-RPC interface is NOT enabled.

For more information about the XML-RPC interface, see the
"WikiRPCInterface" page in the default JSPWiki distribution.
