<p>Business logic beans (ActionBeans) used by JSPs, as defined by
the <a href="http://mc4j.org/confluence/display/stripes/Home">Stripes
MVC framework</a>. In JSPWiki 3.0, the old JSP layer has been completely
overhauled and simplified.</p>

<h3>Overview of Stripes Features Used by JSPWiki 3.0</h3>
<p>The Stripes MVC framework enforces separation of presentation and
page markup (JSPs) from processing logic. By "presentation" we mean
anything that generates valid HTML or related markup, like cascading
stylesheets. By "processing logic" we mean things like:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Extracting request parameters</li>
	<li>Validating submitted form values</li>
	<li>Looking, changing, or saving domain objects (<em>e.g.</em>,
	WikiPages, Groups, UserProfiles)</li>
	<li>Request flow processing (<em>e.g.</em>, redirects)</li>
	<li>Localization of resources</li>
</ul>

<p>In versions of JSPWiki prior to 3.0, JSPs did most of these
things. In 3.0, JSPs do very little, and instead delegate most of the
heavy lifting to the Stripes framework and to special JavaBeans called <a
	href="http://stripes.sourceforge.net/docs/current/javadoc/net/sourceforge/stripes/action/ActionBean.html">ActionBeans</a>.
These ActionBeans contain getters/setters that are used to store
parameter values extracted from the HTTP request, and additional methods
called <em>events</em> that correspond to the values that old-style
JSPWiki templates stored in their "action" form parameters.</p>
<p>Every ActionBean contains a reference to the related object
called the <a
	href="http://stripes.sourceforge.net/docs/current/javadoc/net/sourceforge/stripes/action/ActionBeanContext.html">ActionBeanContext</a>,
which allows callers to access the HTTP request and response objects,
user's Locale, and other objects related to the context in which the
ActionBean was invoked.</p>
<p>In JSPWiki 3.0, we provide a subclass called {@link
com.ecyrd.jspwiki.action.WikiActionBean} whose methods {@link
com.ecyrd.jspwiki.action.WikiActionBean#getContext()} and {@link
com.ecyrd.jspwiki.action.WikiActionBean#setContext(ActionBeanContext)}
that correctly return (and set) {@link
com.ecyrd.jspwiki.ui.stripes.WikiActionBeanContext}, a subclass of
ActionBeanContext that contains accessors for things needed by JSPWiki,
such as {@link
com.ecyrd.jspwiki.ui.stripes.WikiActionBeanContext#getEngine()} and
{@link
com.ecyrd.jspwiki.ui.stripes.WikiActionBeanContext#getWikiSession()}.</p>

<h3>Request parameter binding</h3>
<p>Stripes includes a very cool, easy-to-understand technique for <a
	href="http://stripesframework.org/display/stripes/Quick+Start+Guide">automatically
populating WikiActionBeans</a> with submitted request parameters. Basically
it boils down to this: if you have a request parameter that you want to
map to a bean value, just create getters and setters that have same
field name. Stripes will detect which parameters correspond to
ActionBean fields, and will set the values automatically. For example,
consider JSPWiki 2.<em>x</em>'s <code>Edit.jsp</code> that edits wiki
pages. Page-related parameters supplied to this JSP include:</p>
<ul>
	<li><code>changenote</code></li>
	<li><code>author</code></li>
	<li><code>edittime</code></li>
	<li><code>link</code></li>
	<li><code>htmlPageText</code></li>
</ul>

<p>These are parameters we need in order to save the wiki page
correctly. Some of them are mandatory, and some aren't. In JSPWiki 3.0,
responsibility for parsing and validating all of these parameters reside
with Stripes. What happens is that when <code>Edit.jsp</code> is
rendered, Stripes instantiates a corresponding WikiActionBean subclass
called {@link com.ecyrd.jspwiki.action.EditActionBean} and automatically
calls the correct accessors. In this example, the getters/setters look
like this:</p>

<pre>public String getChangenote() { ... }
public void setChangenote(String note) { ... }

public String getAuthor() { ... }
public void setAuthor(String author) { ... }

public String getEdittime() { ... }
public void setEdittime(String time) { ... }

public String getLink() { ... }
public void setLink(String link) { ... }

public String getHtmlPageText() { ... }
public void setHtmlPageText(String text) { ... }</pre>

<p>As you can see, there is a straight 1-to-1 binding between the
getter/setter field names (<em>e.g.</em>, <code>getChangenote</code>/<code>setChangenote</code>)
and request parameters (<code>changenote</code>). So, when the URL <code>Edit.jsp?changenote=Finished</code>
is requested, Stripes invokes ViewActionBean's <code>setChangenote</code>
method and passes the String "Finished". This is all done completely
automatically -- there is no code to write.</p>

<blockquote><strong>Guideline #1 for JSPWiki
developers</strong>: processing code that extracts request parameters should be
moved into WikiActionBean getter and setter fields. For example, if the
parameter <code>foo</code> is needed, add methods <code>setFoo</code>
and <code>getFoo</code> to the ActionBean). The field types can be <a
	href="http://stripes.sourceforge.net/docs/current/javadoc/net/sourceforge/stripes/validation/TypeConverter.html">any
type that Stripes knows how to convert</a>, such as <code>int</code>, <code>long</code>,
<code>Date</code>, <code>String</code>, <code>BigDecimal</code> and
others, or JSPWiki-specific types we've built converters for: WikiPage
(via {@link com.ecyrd.jspwiki.ui.stripes.WikiPageTypeConverter}), Group
(via {@link com.ecyrd.jspwiki.ui.stripes.GroupTypeConverter}, and
Principal (via {@link
com.ecyrd.jspwiki.ui.stripes.PrincipalTypeConverter}).</blockquote>

<h3>Bindings ActionBeans to URLs</h3>
<p>All of this sounds great, but all of this assumes that somebody
(us, Stripes, or God) knows how to bind the JSP <code>Edit.jsp</code> to
our magic EditActionBean. How do we do this? Binding is done in two
ways: manually in our JSPs by telling Stripes what bean to use, and
automatically by Stripes when its servlet filter (StripesFilter) detects
URLs that end in <code>.action</code>. JSPWiki uses both methods.</p>

<p><strong>Manual binding via JSP markup</strong></p>
<p>In JSPWiki 3.0, each top-level JSP is mapped to one, and only
one, WikiActionBean. Each JSP declares what WikiActionBean it needs by
including the following line:
<p>
<blockquote><code>&lt;<a
	href="http://stripes.sourceforge.net/docs/current/taglib/stripes/useActionBean.html">stripes:useActionBean</a>
beanclass="com.ecyrd.jspwiki.action.<em>foo</em>ActionBean"/&gt;</code></blockquote>
<p>... where <em>foo</em> corresponds to a named action, such as <code>View</code>
(for viewing wiki pages) and <code>UserProfile</code> (for editing a
user's profile). For example, the page-editing JSP, <code>Edit.jsp</code>,
contains this line:</p>

<blockquote><code>&lt;stripes:useActionBean
beanclass="com.ecyrd.jspwiki.action.EditActionBean"/&gt;</code></blockquote>

<p>See this package for a complete list of WikiActionBeans used in
JSPWiki 3.0. By convention, every top-level JSP in JSPWiki 3.0 <em>must</em>
include a <code>&lt;stripes:useActionBean&gt;</code> tag at the top of
their pages. This does three things: first, it guarantees that the
specified WikiActionBean will be injected into into the PageContext's
request scope with the well-known name {@link
com.ecyrd.jspwiki.ui.stripes.WikiInterceptor#ATTR_ACTIONBEAN}
("wikiActionBean"). Second, it also means that JSTL expression language
(EL) markup can access the WikiActionBean directly, for example, <code>${wikiActionBean.changenote}</code>.
Third, it ensures that all of the request parameters we expect will be
correctly bound to the WikiActionBean.</p>

<p>In case you were wondering: conceptually, using <code>&lt;stripes:useActionBean&gt;</code>
to instantiate WikiActionBeans is analogous to creating old-style "wiki
contexts" JSPWiki versions prior to 3.0 using code like this:</p>

<blockquote><code>WikiContext wikiContext =
wiki.createContext( request, WikiContext.EDIT );</code></blockquote>

<p>...although of course in 3.0 we do things via Stripes JSP tags
rather than scriptlet code. WikiContexts aren't forgotten though; in
fact, WikiContext is <em>implemented</em> by WikiActionBeanContext.
That's right: we've refactored WikiContext so that it is now an
interface whose methods can be accessed via a WikiActionBeanContext that
is compatible with Stripes. Because we store the WikiActionBean as a
request attribute, JSP authors can use and evaluate expressions like
this:</p>

<blockquote><code>${wikiActionBean.context.wikiSession.loginName}</code></blockquote>

<p>...where the WikiContext is denoted by the EL expression <code>context</code>,
a property of <code>wikiActionBean</code>. EL syntax can be used to
navigate much more complicated object graphs than this, but you get the
idea. What could be easier?</p>

<blockquote><strong>Guideline #2 for JSPWiki
developers</strong>: JSPs should not attempt to instantiate WikiContexts
directly. Instead, they <em>must</em> include a <code>&lt;stripes:useActionBean
beanclass="com.ecyrd.jspwiki.action.<em>foo</em>Bean"/&gt;</code> element that
tells JSPWiki which WikiActionBean to use. For example, <code>&lt;stripes:useActionBean
beanclass="com.ecyrd.jspwiki.action.EditActionBean"/&gt;</code> tells a JSPWiki
to automatically instantiate the wiki context EditActionBean and place
it in request scope. To retrieve the WikiActionBean later, call {@link
com.ecyrd.jspwiki.ui.stripes.WikiInterceptor#findActionBean(ServletRequest)}.</blockquote>

<p><strong>Automatic binding to <code>.action</code> URLs</strong></p>
<p>In addition to the manual method for binding WikiActionBeans to
JSPs, Stripes also automatically binds ActionBeans to URLs that contain
the <code>.action</code> suffix. When it detects such a URL, it tries to
locate and bind the correct ActionBean by scanning for ActionBean
subclasses whose names share the same prefix and whose suffixes are
ActionBean or Action. For example, the URL <code>Group.action</code>
causes Stripes to look for ActionBeans called <code>GroupActionBean</code>
and <code>GroupAction</code>, and if a class with that name is found,
Stripes will instantiate one of these and bind its fields to the request
parameters.</p>

<p>Stripes also attempts to locate ActionBeans by looking for a
special class-level annotation, <code><a
	href="http://stripes.sourceforge.net/docs/current/javadoc/net/sourceforge/stripes/action/UrlBinding.html">@UrlBinding</a></code>,
that specifies the mapping. By convention, this is how we do things in
JSPWiki 3.0. For example, the ViewActionBean class contains this
annotation:</p>

<blockquote><code>@UrlBinding("/Wiki.action")</code></blockquote>

<p>This annotation guarantees that any time StripesFilter encounters
the URL <code>/Wiki.Action</code>, an instance of ViewActionBean will be
instantiated and injected into the request as an attribute; its fields
will also be bound in the same way as the manual method.</p>

<p>Automatic ActionBean binding is typically done upon form
submission, because Stripes' form tags cause forms to be posted to <code>.action</code>
URLs. For this reason, automatic binding also causes fields to be
validated as well (more on this shortly).</p>

<blockquote><strong>Guideline #3 for JSPWiki
developers</strong>: every WikiActionBean subclass should contain a class-level <code>@UrlBinding</code>
annotation that tells Stripes how to locate the bean when user submit
forms.</blockquote>

<blockquote><strong>Guideline #4 for JSPWiki
developers</strong>: JSPs can -- and should -- use JSP 2.0 EL syntax to access
properties of the current WikiActionBean. JSPWiki guarantees that when
the <code>&lt;useActionBean&gt;</code> tag is present, the ActionBean
will be made available as the page attibute <code>wikiActionBean</code>.
For example, <code>${wikiActionBean.context.wikiSession.loginName}</code>
prints the user's login name.</blockquote>

<h3>ActionBean Events</h3>
<p>As discussed at the beginning of this page, Stripes ActionBeans
includes getters and setters for parameters that are extracted from the
request stream. ActionBeans also include methods that are annotated as
"events," which respond to client activities like form POSTs. In JSPWiki
2.<em>x</em>, events were (very roughly) implemented using JSP scriptlet
code. For example, consider this snippet from the old <code>UserPreferences.jsp</code>:</p>

<pre>String action  = request.getParameter("action");
if( "createAssertedName".equals(action) )
{
   ...
   (event processing code goes here)
   ...
}</pre>

<p>Scriptlets like these served only to clutter up JSPs with lots of
spaghetti code. With Stripes, all event processing code is moved into
ActionBean methods that have a special <code><a
	href="http://stripes.sourceforge.net/docs/current/javadoc/net/sourceforge/stripes/action/HandlesEvent.html">@HandlesEvent</a></code>
annotation. For example, the user preferences code that previously
created user name assertions moved into an annotated <code>addAssertionCookie()</code>
method that does the work by "handling" the event <code>createAssertedName</code>:</p>

<pre>@HandlesEvent("createAssertedName")
public Resolution addAssertionCookie()
{
    ...
    (event processing code goes here)
    ...
    return new RedirectResolution("/");
}</pre>

<p>The effect of moving POST processing code into ActionBeans
dramatically simplifies JSPs. But you might be wondering, how does
Stripes know how (and when) it should call ActionBean event methods?
Simple: a series of simple JSP tags, modeled after their HTML
counterparts, tells Stripes what beans and events it should invoke. For
example:</p>

<pre>&lt;stripes:form id="preferences" action="/UserPreferences.action" method="POST" acceptcharset="UTF-8"&gt;
  ...
  (form markup)
  ...
  &lt;stripes:submit name="createAssertedName"/&gt;
&lt;/stripes:form&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</pre>

<p>Here, the <code><a
	href="http://stripes.sourceforge.net/docs/current/taglib/stripes/form.html">stripes:form</a></code>
tag includes an <code>action</code> parameter that specifies the URL to
post to. Because the {@link
com.ecyrd.jspwiki.action.UserPreferencesActionBean} contains a
class-level <code>@UrlBinding("/UserPreferences.action")</code>
annotation, Stripes knows that this corresponds to that bean class
UserPreferencesActionBean. And because the <code><a
	href="http://stripes.sourceforge.net/docs/current/taglib/stripes/submit.html">stripes:submit</a></code>
tag's <code>name</code> attribute contains the value <code>createAssertedName</code>,
Stripes knows that it needs to locate and call the corresponding method
that handles that event, in this case <code>addAssertionCookie</code>.
<p>Note: an alternative syntax for &lt;stripes:form&gt; uses the <code>beanClass</code>
attribute instead of <code>action</code>, which might be a little easier
in some cases. This is functionally equivalent:</p>

<pre>&lt;stripes:form id="preferences" action="/UserPreferences.action" method="POST" acceptcharset="UTF-8"&gt;</pre>

<blockquote><strong>Guideline #5 for JSPWiki
developers</strong>: processing code that handles form POST activities (that
would have ordinarily gone into top-level JSPs) should <em>always</em>
be moved into WikiActionBean event handler methods. These methods should
contain a <code>@HandlesEvent</code> annotation that specifies which
named event it handles. On JSPs, each event name should have an
equivalent <code>&lt;stripes:submit&gt;</code> button; for example, <code>&lt;stripes:submit
name="createAssertedName"/&gt;</code>. Its containing &lt;stripes:form&gt;
element's <code>action</code> should contain the URL of the ActionBean
the event pertains to, or alternative a <code>beanClass</code> attribute
that names the ActionBean class explicitly. Example: <code>&lt;stripes:form
beanClass="UserPreferencesAction.class"&gt;</code></blockquote>

<blockquote><strong>Guideline #6 for JSPWiki
developers</strong>: all <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> tags and related markup (such
as <code>&lt;input&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;option&gt;</code>)
should use the Stripes tags instead (<em>e.g.</em>, <code>&lt;stripes:form&gt;</code>,
<code><a
	href="http://stripes.sourceforge.net/docs/current/taglib/stripes/text.html">&lt;stripes:text&gt;</a></code>,
<code><a
	href="http://stripes.sourceforge.net/docs/current/taglib/stripes/textarea.html">&lt;stripes:textarea&gt;</a></code>,
<code><a
	href="http://stripes.sourceforge.net/docs/current/taglib/stripes/option.html">&lt;stripes:option&gt;</a></code>).
With one or two exceptions, these tags are identical to their HTML
equivalents, and contain a few extra attributes used by Stripes.</blockquote>

<h3>Form validation</h3>
<p>Because JSPWiki 3.0 uses Stripes, our WikiActionBeans take
advantage of another terrific feature: automatic form field validation
based on annotations. Recall previously that ActionBeans have getters
and setters that Stripes uses to store and retrieve request parameters.
For validation, either the getter or setter (by convention, the setter)
can also contain a <code><a
	href="http://stripes.sourceforge.net/docs/current/javadoc/net/sourceforge/stripes/validation/Validate.html">@validate</a></code>
annotation that indicates whether values are required, and what their
acceptable lengths or constraints might be. For example, consider {@link
com.ecyrd.jspwiki.action.UserProfileActionBean}, a WikiActionBean that
allows users to edit their user profile information. The <code>fullname</code>
field has this annotation right above the setter:</p>

<blockquote><code>@Validate(field="fullname",
required=true, maxlength=100)</code></blockquote>

<p>This annotation tells Stripes that the <code>fullname</code>
field is a required field, and that its length must be less than 100
characters. When the form is POSTed, Stripes will check to see if this
field was submitted by the user, and if not, automatically generate an
error message that can be retrieved later. (By the <code>&lt;stripes:errors&gt;</code>
tag, incidentally.) But Stripes can do more than simple text field
validation. Here is the annotation for UserProfileActionBean's <code>email</code>
field:</p>

<blockquote><code>@Validate(field="email", required
= false, converter = <a
	href="http://stripes.sourceforge.net/docs/current/javadoc/net/sourceforge/stripes/validation/EmailTypeConverter.html">EmailTypeConverter.class</a>)</code></blockquote>

<p>In this case, Stripes will use one of its own custom String
converters to validate the e-mail address. In addition to these two
validators (for Strings and e-mail addresses), Stripes also converts and
validates dates, times, integers, longs, doubles, and <a
	href="http://stripes.sourceforge.net/docs/current/javadoc/net/sourceforge/stripes/validation/TypeConverter.html">many
other types</a>. It "knows" which converter to invoke because of the field's
type. In addition to Stripes' own converters, JSPWiki 3.0 contains
converters for fields of type WikiPage, Group and Principal.</p>

<blockquote><strong>Guideline #7 for JSPWiki
developers</strong>: When creating WikiActionBeans, all fields that require
validation should have <code>@validate</code> annotations on their
setter methods.</blockquote>

<h3>Pageflow and Redirection</h3>
<p>Browser redirects and related pageflow issues are handled very
differently in JSPWiki 3.0 than in previous versions. Previously,
redirects were implemented directly in JSP scriptlet code. For example,
consider this snippet from <code>Edit.jsp</code>:</p>

<pre>if( change != null && change.getTime() != pagedate )
{
    //
    // Someone changed the page while we were editing it!
    //

    log.info("Page changed, warning user.");

    session.setAttribute( EditorManager.REQ_EDITEDTEXT, EditorManager.getEditedText(pageContext) );
    response.sendRedirect( wiki.getURL(WikiContext.CONFLICT, pagereq, null, false) );
    return;
}</pre>

<p>In JSPWiki 3.0, these activities fall into the category of
"processing logic" -- the type of code that gets put into WikiActionBean
events. In this particular case, the code moves into a Stripes event
handler method in the EditActionBean class that has an <code>@HandlesEvent</code>
annotation with the name <code>save</code>.</p>

<p>When a Stripes event handler method needs to redirect a user to
another page, it returns an object called a <a
	href="http://stripes.sourceforge.net/docs/current/javadoc/net/sourceforge/stripes/action/Resolution.html">Resolution</a>
that tells Stripes how to proceed. Stripes contains four easy-to-use
Resolutions:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong><a
		href="http://stripes.sourceforge.net/docs/current/javadoc/net/sourceforge/stripes/action/ForwardResolution.html">ForwardResolution</a></strong>:
	forwards the user to another path within the same web application using
	a server side forward. Constructors include:
	<ul>
		<li><code>ForwardResolution(Class<? extends ActionBean> beanType, String event)</code> - Constructs a ForwardResolution that will forward to the URL appropriate for the ActionBean supplied.</li>
      <li><code>ForwardResolution(String path)</code> - Simple constructor that takes in the path to forward the user to.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong><a href="http://stripes.sourceforge.net/docs/current/javadoc/net/sourceforge/stripes/ajax/JavaScriptResolution.html">JavaScriptResolution</a></strong>: converts a Java object web to a web of JavaScript objects and arrays, and stream the JavaScript back to the client. The output of this resolution can be evaluated in JavaScript using the eval() function, and will return a reference to the top level JavaScript object. Constructors include:
    <ul>
      <li><code>JavaScriptResolution(Object rootObject, Class<?>...
		userTypesExcluded)</code></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong><a
		href="http://stripes.sourceforge.net/docs/current/javadoc/net/sourceforge/stripes/action/RedirectResolution.html">RedirectResolution</a></strong>:
	redirects the user to another path by issuing a client side redirect.
	Constructors include:
	<ul>
		<li><code>RedirectResolution(Class&lt;? extends
		ActionBean&gt; beanType)</code> - Constructs a RedirectResolution that will
		redirect to the URL appropriate for the ActionBean supplied.</li>
		<li><code>RedirectResolution(Class&lt;? extends
		ActionBean&gt; beanType, String event)</code> - Constructs a
		RedirectResolution that will redirect to the URL appropriate for the
		ActionBean supplied.</li>
		<li><code>RedirectResolution(String url)</code> - Simple
		constructor that takes the URL to which to forward the user.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>

	<li><strong><a
		href="http://stripes.sourceforge.net/docs/current/javadoc/net/sourceforge/stripes/action/StreamingResolution.html">StreamingResolution</a></strong>:
	streams data back to the client (in place of forwarding the user to
	another page). Designed to be used for streaming non-page data such as
	generated images/charts and XML islands.</li>
</ul>

<p>Handler events that need to interrupt processing or return data
to the use simply need to return one of these four resolutions. For
example, the previous scriptlet code could be re-written as an
EditActionBean event handler as follows:
<pre>
&#064;HandlesEvent("save")
public Resolution save()
{
  if( m_change != null && m_change.getTime() != m_pagedate )
  {
      //
      // Someone changed the page while we were editing it!
      //
  
      log.info("Page changed, warning user.");
      
      Resolution r = new RedirectResolution(ConflictActionBean.class).flash( this );
      r.addParameter("page", m_page.getName());
      return r;
  }
}</pre>

<p>The <code>RedirectResolution</code> tells Stripes to redirect the
user to the conflict-editing page, the URL for which Stripes will
automatically locate due to ConflictActionBean's <code>@UrlBinding</code>
annotation (see Guideline #3). It will also append the parameter <code>page</code>
with the value of the page. And finally it will add the current
ActionBean to a temporary storage area called the <a
	href="http://stripes.sourceforge.net/docs/current/javadoc/net/sourceforge/stripes/controller/FlashScope.html">flash
scope</a> where it can be retrieved by the target of the redirect. When the
target (in this case, ConflictActionBean) executes, it can retrieve the
bean stored in flash scope easily:</p>

<pre>FlashScope scope = FlashScope.getCurrent( request, true);
WikiActionBean editContext = (WikiActionBean)scope.get( "/EditActionBean" );</pre>

<p>After retrieving the previously-flashed EditActionBean, its
contents can be retrieved and manipulated like any other bean.</p>

<blockquote><strong>Guideline #8 for JSPWiki
developers</strong>: processing logic that would, in previous versions of
JSPWiki, reside in scriptlet code should be moved into WikiActionBean
event handlers. When an event handler needs to modify the user page flow
or redirect the browser, it should return a suitable Resolution, such as
the RedirectResolution.</blockquote>

<blockquote><strong>Guideline #9 for JSPWiki
developers</strong>: client-side code that need to retrieve AJAX or JSON data
from JSPWiki should POST to a WikiActionBean event handler, which should
in turn return a <code>JavaScriptResolution</code> or a <code>StreamingResolution</code>.</blockquote>

<blockquote><strong>Guideline #10 for JSPWiki
developers</strong>: event handlers that need to ensure that the current
WikiActionBean is accessible by the next one in the request cycle should
add themselves to "flash scope" by calling the Resolution's <code><a
	href="http://stripes.sourceforge.net/docs/current/javadoc/net/sourceforge/stripes/action/RedirectResolution.html#flash(net.sourceforge.stripes.action.ActionBean)">flash()</a></code>
method. These can be retrieved by the next ActionBean by retrieving the
current FlashScope for the request and calling its <code><a
	href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/HashMap.html#get(java.lang.Object)">get()</a></code>
method and passing the URLBinding as a parameter.</blockquote>
