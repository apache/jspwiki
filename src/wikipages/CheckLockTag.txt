Checks the existence of a [page lock].  A [page lock] is created when an user starts editing a page.  You can use this tag to warn the user, prevent the page from being modified (by removing the editor text area, for example), etc.

!Usage

<wiki:CheckLock mode="locked|unlocked" id="<variable>">
;:''content''
</wiki:CheckLock>

!Parameters

;__mode__: If set to "locked", will include the content if the page has been locked; any other value includes if the page is not locked.

!Example
{{{
      <wiki:CheckLock mode="locked" id="lock">
         <P CLASS="locknote">User '<%=lock.getLocker()%>' has started to edit this page, but has not yet
         saved.  I won't stop you from editing this page anyway, BUT be aware that
         the other person might be quite annoyed.  It would be courteous to wait for his lock
         to expire or until he stops editing the page.  The lock expires in
         <%=lock.getTimeLeft()%> minutes.
         </P>
      </wiki:CheckLock>
}}}
