!Wiki configuration

The least pain approach to defining the location of your Wiki files is
to have them on the same drive as your Tomcat (or other web server)
installation, and define the location in Unix format. For example,
files in C:\JSPWiki\files are defined in the configuration file as
/JSPWiki/files.

!Version control

If you need version control for your JSPWiki installation on a Windows
machine, download the implementation from
[http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/trinkle/RCS/]. You only need the
executables in the win32 directory of the rcs57pc1.zip.

The RCS executables will not work unless you set:
* PATH environment variable to point to the location of the executables
* TZ environment variable to a value suitable for your locale (this value must
  be set; I have failed to get it working properly, though)
* You also may need to set the LOGNAME environment variable.
