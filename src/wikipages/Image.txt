The Image plugin allows one to have finer control over the layout of images than just the simple inling of images.

!Parameters

* __src__ = ''Image source''.  This can either be a full URL (http://...) or a [WikiAttachment] name.  Required.
* __align__ = ''left|right|center''.  The image alignment.
* __height__ = ''integer''.  Force the height of the image.
* __width__ = ''integer''.  Force the width of the image.
* __alt__ = ''alt text''.   The alt text of an image.  This is very useful when doing pages that can be navigated with text-only browsers.
* __caption__ = ''caption text''.  The text that should be shown as a caption under the image.
* __link__ = ''hyperlink''.  A hyperlink (http://...).  In the future, you can also use [WikiPages].
* __border__ = ''integer''.  Size of the image border.
* __style__ = ''style info''.  Any style markup you would like to apply to the table surrounding the image.
* __class__ = ''class name''.  Redefine the default class for this
 image, which is "imageplugin".

!Example

[[{Image src='SandBox/test.png' caption='Testing image' style='font-size: 120%; color: green;'}].

Shows the attachment SandBox/test.png with the caption "Testing image" underneath it.  The text is 120% in height and will be rendered in green color.

!CSS

* {{.imageplugin}} = The table that encompasses the image.  It consists of two undercategories:
** {{img}} = The IMG tag that gets embedded.
** {{caption}} = The caption that is embedded.
