When you've figured out how the editor works, then you should read [WikiEtiquette] so that you would know how to use your newly acquired skills...

!Quick reference

{{{
---- = Make a horizontal ruler. Extra '-' is ignored.
\\ = force a line break
[link] = creates a hyperlink to an internal WikiPage called 'Link'.
[this is also a link] = creates a hyperlink to an internal WikiPage called
'ThisIsAlsoALink'.
[click here|link] = creates a hyperlink to an internal WikiPage called
'Link', but displays the text 'click here' to the
user instead of 'Link'.
[[link] = creates text '[link]'.
!heading = small heading with text 'heading'
!!heading = medium heading with text 'heading'
!!!heading = large heading with text 'heading'
''text'' = prints 'text' in italic.
__text__ = prints 'text' in bold.
{{text}} = prints 'text' in monospaced font.
* text = makes a bulleted list item with 'text'
# text = makes a numbered list item with 'text'
}}}

!Hyperlinks
The link can also be a direct URL starting with http:, ftp:, mailto:, https:, or news:, in which case the link points to an external entity. For example, to point at the java.sun.com home page, use [[http://java.sun.com], which becomes [http://java.sun.com/] or [[Java home page|http://java.sun.com], which becomes [Java home page|http://java.sun.com].

To add a new page you just create a link to it from somewhere else. After all, there isn't much point in having a page if you can't access it! You'll then see a small question mark after the page name when you return to that page. Then click on it and you have created a new page!

!InterWiki links

You can also do links between different Wikis without knowing the URL.  Just use a link in the form [[Wiki:WikiPage] and JSPWiki will create a link for you.  For example, this link points to the [JSPWiki TextFormatting rules|JSPWiki:TextFormattingRules]. Check the [SystemInfo] page for more information on which Wiki links are available.

If an InterWiki link is not supported, you'll get a notification of it on the page when
you save your page.

!Adding pictures

For security reasons uploading images is not permitted, but you can embed
any image in the wiki code by putting the image available somewhere on the web in [PNG] format, and then just linking to it.
All PNG images are automatically inlined.  For example, this is a [PNG] image: [http://www.ecyrd.com/~jalkanen/test.png].

If you specify a link text ([[this one here|http://example.com/example.png]) it becomes
the ALT text for those who either can't or don't want to view images.

!Bulleted lists
Use an asterisk (*) in the first column to make bulleted lists. Use more asterisks for deeper indentation. For example:
{{{
* One
* Two
* Three
** Three.One}}}

creates
* One
* Two
* Three
** Three.One

!Numbered lists
Just like with bulleted lists, but use a hash (#) instead of the asterisk. Like this:
{{{
# One
# Two
# Three
## Three.One
}}}

creates
# One
# Two
# Three
## Three.One

If you want to write the list item on multiple lines, just add one or more spaces on the next line and the line will be automatically added to the
previous item.  If this sounds complicated, edit this page for an example, below.

* This is a single-line item.
* This is actually a multi-line item.
  We continue the second sentence on a line on a line of its own.
  We might as well do a third line while we're at it...
  Notice, however, as all these sentences get put inside a single item!
* The third line is again a single-line item for your convinience.

!Text effects

You may use __bold__ text or ''italic'' text, by using two underscores (_) and two single quotes ('), respectively. If you're on a Windows computer, make sure that you are using the correct quote sign, as there is one that looks the same, but really isn't.


!Preformatted text

If you want to add preformatted text (like code) just use three consecutive braces ({) to open a block, and three consecutive braces (}) to close a block. Edit this page for an example.

!Conflicts

If someone happens to edit the same page as you at the same time, JSPWiki will prevent you from doing changes and show a conflict page instead. Sorry to say, but the first one to make changes wins...

__A word of warning:__ If you use the Back button of your browser to go into the Edit page, you will almost certainly get a conflict. This is because the browser thinks its still editing an earlier copy of the page.

!Deleting pages

This is not possible. You can, of course, remove all the links to that page, which makes it inaccesible. Or you can [email me|mailto:jalkanen+jspwiki@regex.fi], and I'll remove the page.

!Adding new pages

Create a link that points to a new (not existing) page using its [WikiName].
Click that new link, which should now have a question mark (?) suffix and
you will get an editor for the new page. -- [Asser]
