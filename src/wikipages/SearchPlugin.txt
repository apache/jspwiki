The "Search" plugin allows you to access the JSPWiki search routines and show the displays in an array on your page.

!Parameters

* __query__ = ''String''.  A standard JSPWiki search query.
* __max__ = ''Integer''.  How many search results are shown at maximum.
* __set__ = ''String''.  The JSPWiki context variable that will hold the results of the query.  This allows you to pass your queries to other plugins on the same page as well.

!Example

{{{
[{Search query='Janne' max=10}]
}}}

might produce a result somewhat like this:

[{Search query='Janne' max=10}]
