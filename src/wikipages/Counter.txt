A simple counter that starts counting at 1 at the top of the page, and each time it is invoked, will increase its value by one.   These counters are transient, and relative to the current page view only - i.e. two persons viewing the same page at the same time get their own counters.

The current counter value is accessible also as a [WikiVariable].  The name of the variable is "counter", or "counter-<name>", if you have defined a counter name.

!Parameters

* __name__ = ''counter name''.  You may define as many counters per page as you want; you just need to separate them with the ''counter name''

!Example

[[{Counter}], [[{Counter}], [[{Counter}], [[{Counter name='aa'}] produces

[{Counter}], [{Counter}], [{Counter}], [{Counter name='aa'}].

The value of "counter" at the end is [{$counter}] and the value of "counter-aa" is [{$counter-aa}].
