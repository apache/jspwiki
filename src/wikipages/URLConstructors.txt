An URL Constructor is a JSPWiki plugin which can be used to control how the different URLs that JSPWiki generates should look like.

!Choosing your URLConstructor

JSPWiki includes three basic URLConstructors for managing link generation:

* [DefaultURLConstructor] - which you're probably using right now.
* [ShortViewURLConstructor] - replaces "Wiki.jsp" with the ~WikiServlet.
* [ShortURLConstructor] - replaces all JSP pages with the ~WikiServlet.

!Using a URLConstructor

Edit your jspwiki.properties file, and add the following line:
{{{
jspwiki.urlConstructor = <constructor name>
}}}

For example:
{{{
jspwiki.baseURL = http://example.com/
jspwiki.urlConstructor = ShortURLConstructor
jspwiki.shortURLConstructor.prefix = /mywiki/
}}}

would use the ShortURLConstructor with a prefix of "/mywiki/".  All relative URLs would look like "/mywiki/Foobar" and all absolute URLs would look like "http://example.com/mywiki/Foobar".
